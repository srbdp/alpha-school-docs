# Contact Information

> Contact methods and communication channels for Alpha School inquiries, enrollment, media, and campus-specific questions

## Overview

Alpha School employs a web form-first contact strategy, routing most general inquiries through HubSpot-powered forms at alpha.school/learn-more rather than publishing direct phone numbers or general email addresses. This approach allows Alpha to manage high volumes of inquiries and ensure proper routing to the appropriate team members based on inquiry type (enrollment, media, academic records, etc.).

Contact pathways vary by purpose: prospective families use the "Learn More" form or campus-specific admissions contacts, media inquiries go to press@2hourlearning.com, academic records requests go to registrar@alpha.school, and job seekers apply through an external Crossover careers portal. Campus-specific contacts (phone and email) are available for select campuses including Austin, Fort Worth, Miami, and Scottsdale, while other campuses route inquiries through the central contact form.

Phone contact availability is limited: no general inquiry phone number is published on alpha.school, though some individual campuses provide direct phone lines. A phone number (512) 358-1672 appears in third-party directories for the Austin campus but is not officially published on Alpha's website. Social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn) provide additional engagement pathways but are primarily for informational content rather than direct inquiry response.

### Contact Strategy

Alpha School intentionally routes most inquiries through web forms (powered by HubSpot) rather than publishing broad phone or email access. This strategy serves several purposes:

1. **Proper Routing**: Web forms allow Alpha to route inquiries to the appropriate department (admissions, registrar, press, etc.) based on inquiry type
2. **Response Tracking**: Form submissions enable tracking and follow-up to ensure inquiries are addressed
3. **Volume Management**: Centralized form intake allows efficient handling of high inquiry volumes
4. **Quality Control**: Forms can collect necessary information upfront (location interest, grade level, inquiry type) to provide more targeted responses

While some campuses provide direct phone lines (Austin, Fort Worth, Miami, Scottsdale), the organization's overall approach emphasizes web form-first contact for general inquiries.

### Information Gaps

The following contact information is **not publicly available**:

1. **General Inquiry Phone Number**: No phone number for general Alpha School inquiries is published on alpha.school
2. **Campus-Specific Phone Numbers**: Most campuses do not publish direct phone lines (only Austin, Fort Worth, Miami, Scottsdale provide phone contact)
3. **Dedicated Contact Page**: alpha.school/contact returns 404 error; no centralized contact directory page exists
4. **Dedicated Press Page**: alpha.school/press returns 404 error; no press kit or media assets downloadable
5. **Separate Corporate Address**: No corporate mailing address distinct from Austin PreK-5 campus (1201 Spyglass Dr)
6. **Investor Relations Contact**: No specific contact for investor relations or partnership inquiries
7. **Individual Staff Emails**: No directory of staff email addresses beyond those in press releases (Anna Davlantes)

**INFORMATION STATUS**: These gaps reflect Alpha School's intentional contact strategy prioritizing web forms and purpose-specific emails over broad contact information publication.

## Examples

### Example 1: Prospective Parent Enrollment Inquiry

A family in Austin interested in enrolling their 4th grader follows this pathway:

1. **Visit**: https://alpha.school/learn-more/
2. **Complete Form**: Provide child's age/grade, location interest (Austin), contact information
3. **Response**: Alpha's admissions team routes inquiry to Austin campus admissions
4. **Alternative**: Direct contact to admissions.austin@alpha.school or call (512) 595-0801

This multi-channel approach gives families flexibility while ensuring proper routing to the Austin campus admissions team.
