# Grade Levels

> Alpha School's PreK-12 capability-based level system enables students to progress through developmental stages based on demonstrated mastery (90%+ accuracy) rather than age or time, with structured curriculum for PreK-8 students and self-directed learning for high school students.

## Overview

Alpha School serves PreK-12 students, though specific grade ranges vary by location—for example, Alpha Austin operates as a preK-12 school. Unlike traditional schools that advance students based on age or time spent in class, Alpha uses "levels that are based on specific capabilities as opposed to traditional grade models." Students progress through material by demonstrating mastery (90%+ accuracy) on each topic, eliminating cumulative knowledge gaps that plague traditional grade-based cohorts where students can pass with partial understanding.

The program features two distinct developmental stages. PreK-8 students follow a structured curriculum with prescribed workshops and guided academic progression through core subjects, blending systematic skill-building with age-appropriate life skills activities. High school students transition to self-directed "super passion projects" spanning four years, receiving dedicated mentorship and greater autonomy in afternoon activities while maintaining the same rigorous academic expectations. Both stages preserve the 2-hour morning academic block with AI-powered mastery-based instruction.

Standards alignment ensures grade-appropriate content at each level. PreK-8 students follow Common Core curriculum, guaranteeing coverage of foundational literacy, mathematics, and science concepts aligned with national benchmarks. High school students work through Advanced Placement curriculum including AP Calculus, Statistics, English Language, English Literature, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Alpha claims students can accelerate through grade-level material in just 20-30 hours of focused study (versus traditional 200 hours) while maintaining rigorous mastery standards, enabling advanced learners to progress rapidly without compromising educational quality.

## Details

### Grade Range and Location Variability

Alpha School serves PreK-12 students, though specific grade ranges vary by campus location. Alpha Austin operates as a preK-12 school, providing a full spectrum from early childhood through high school graduation. Other locations may serve different grade ranges depending on local demand and operational capacity. Parents should verify grade availability at their specific campus when considering enrollment. "K-12" is the most commonly cited range across public sources, with some locations extending downward to include PreK programming for younger learners.

### Capability-Based vs. Age-Based Levels

Alpha uses "levels that are based on specific capabilities as opposed to traditional grade models," according to the school's FAQ. Students are grouped and advance based on demonstrated mastery of specific skills, not chronological age or time spent in seat. This eliminates the traditional grade-based cohort model where students advance annually regardless of understanding. The AI platform tracks each student's individual mastery across subjects, determining readiness for the next level by requiring 90%+ accuracy before progression. This approach allows acceleration for advanced students who demonstrate rapid mastery, while providing additional support time for learners who need it—all without the artificial constraints of age-based advancement. Students maintain appropriate developmental groupings (PreK-8 structure vs. high school structure) while enabling individual pacing within subjects and levels.

### PreK-8 vs. High School Structures

PreK-8 students follow a structured curriculum designed for systematic skill-building. They complete prescribed workshop curricula in afternoon sessions, progressing through core academics via AI platforms with guided support from staff. This stage blends academic rigor with age-appropriate life skills workshops like "Picnic Planners" (PreK), "Water for Life Project" (K-1), and "Business Launch Pad" (grades 4-5), emphasizing foundational competencies through structured routines and clear expectations.

High school students receive significantly more self-directed learning opportunities. They pursue "super passion projects" spanning all four years of high school—for example, developing a teen dating advice chatbot in collaboration with Stanford and University of Texas researchers. These students receive dedicated mentorship, source their own learning resources, and exercise greater autonomy in afternoon activities while maintaining the same 2-hour morning academic block for mastery-based progression through AP-level coursework. The transition from PreK-8 to high school represents a deliberate shift from guided structure to mentored independence, preserving mastery-based academic standards while developing student agency and self-direction.

## Examples

### Example 1: PreK Workshop Experience

PreK students at Alpha School participate in age-appropriate workshops like "Picnic Planners" and "LEGO Master Builder"—activities designed to build teamwork, creativity, and foundational life skills through hands-on projects. During the morning academic block, these youngest learners engage with AI platforms adapted for early childhood, covering foundational literacy and numeracy skills at their individual capability levels. The structured schedule provides clear routines, guided transitions, and systematic skill-building appropriate for 4-5 year olds while introducing them to mastery-based learning from the start.

### Example 2: K-8 Mastery-Based Progression

A 5th grade student working through the math curriculum completes a unit on fractions, demonstrating 90%+ mastery through practice problems and assessments. The AI platform automatically advances this student to the next topic (decimals), building on the solid fraction foundation just established. Meanwhile, a classmate in the same grade level continues working on multiplication tables, receiving continued support and practice until achieving the 90%+ mastery threshold. Both students work in the same grade-level cohort but at different capability levels within mathematics, eliminating the traditional scenario where "C students pass anyway" and accumulate knowledge gaps. Each progresses based on demonstrated understanding, not calendar advancement.

### Example 3: High School Self-Direction

A high school student pursues a four-year "super passion project" developing a teen dating advice chatbot, collaborating with researchers at Stanford and the University of Texas. This project spans multiple competency areas—coding, psychology, user experience design, research methodology—and requires the student to source specialized resources, manage timelines, and seek expert mentorship. During the 2-hour morning academic block, this same student continues progressing through AP-level coursework (AP Calculus, English Literature, Biology) at their own pace, maintaining rigorous academic standards. Afternoons are devoted to project advancement, mentorship sessions, skill acquisition, and resource development. This structure exemplifies the transition to mentored independence: high academic expectations paired with significant autonomy in pursuit of personally meaningful, complex projects.
