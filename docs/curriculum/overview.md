# Curriculum Overview

> Alpha School's mastery-based K-12 curriculum combines 2-hour AI-powered core academics requiring 90% proficiency for advancement with a 4-hour hands-on life skills program teaching 24 competencies through real-world projects, enabling personalized progression aligned with Common Core and Advanced Placement standards.

## Overview

Alpha School's curriculum philosophy centers on mastery-based learning where students must demonstrate over 90% accuracy before advancing to new material (according to alpha.school), though some secondary sources report an 80% threshold—this discrepancy may reflect different requirements for daily lessons versus comprehensive mastery tests. The curriculum employs personalized pacing allowing each student to progress based on demonstrated proficiency rather than calendar-based advancement, and utilizes spaced repetition to reinforce learning at calculated intervals, preventing the cumulative knowledge gaps that occur when students advance with incomplete understanding.

Core academic subjects—Math, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies (with Reading, Writing, and Foreign Language integrated)—are delivered through AI-powered platforms during a 2-hour morning block. Alpha School's curriculum follows Common Core standards for grades K-8 and Advanced Placement curriculum for high school, delivered through a combination of third-party platforms (IXL, Khan Academy, Math Academy, Synthesis Tutor) and proprietary applications (Alpha Math, AlphaRead, AlphaWrite, Teach Tales, Fluency Coach). A central platform called "Dash" curates each student's pathway through these applications based on continuous performance analysis. According to Alpha materials, students can complete an entire grade level in 20-30 hours of focused study through AI tutoring, compared to approximately 200 hours in traditional schooling, though this efficiency claim has not been independently verified.

Alpha School emphasizes 24 life skills organized across five core areas: Teamwork & Leadership, Storytelling & Public Speaking, Entrepreneurship & Financial Literacy, Relationship Building & Socialization, and Grit & Hard Work. These life skills are taught through approximately four hours of afternoon workshops featuring age-appropriate progression from PreK through high school. According to Alpha materials, students engage in real-world projects including running profitable Airbnbs, operating food trucks, athletic training programs, and public speaking progressions. These workshops culminate in "Tests to Pass" assessments that measure mastery of life skills competencies through performance-based evaluation rather than traditional testing.

## Details

### Mastery-Based Learning Philosophy

Alpha School's curriculum requires students to demonstrate "over 90% accuracy before the system allows them to move on" (per alpha.school), contrasting with traditional schools where students can pass with 70% and advance with significant knowledge gaps. Some secondary sources (GenWise Substack, Astral Codex Ten) report an 80% accuracy threshold; this discrepancy may reflect different thresholds for daily lessons versus comprehensive grade-level mastery tests, as noted in research findings.

The mastery-based philosophy emphasizes personalized pacing where each student progresses at their own speed rather than calendar-based advancement. The curriculum employs spaced repetition—the system brings back topics at calculated intervals to reinforce long-term retention before forgetting occurs. This approach aims to prevent cumulative knowledge gaps: understanding fractions at 90%+ proficiency makes subsequent learning of decimals, percentages, and ratios significantly more efficient.

According to Alpha School materials, this mastery-based approach enables students to complete an entire grade level of material in one subject in only 20-30 hours of focused study through AI tutoring, compared to approximately 200 hours in traditional schooling. Alpha reports students learning 2.6 times faster than national norms on NWEA MAP standardized assessments, with the top two-thirds of students learning 3.6 times faster. These efficiency and performance claims come from Alpha School's own data without independent third-party verification.

The curriculum creates a "knowledge graph" of what each student knows, with the AI platform continuously tracking accuracy and learning speed. When students answer incorrectly, they receive immediate explanations and targeted instruction on identified gaps rather than moving forward without understanding.

### Core Academic Subjects (Morning Block)

Alpha School's curriculum covers four core academic subjects during the 2-hour morning block: Math, English/Language Arts, Science, and History/Social Studies, with Reading, Writing, and Foreign Language integrated throughout. Students complete 8-12 individualized daily lessons called "minimums" delivered through AI-powered platforms.

The morning academic block employs 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with breaks between subjects (called "Q breaks") for physical activity. The AI platform interface "goes green" when mastery is achieved, providing clear visual feedback on progression. Students work through curated videos followed by problem sets with immediate feedback on each question—incorrect answers trigger explanations before proceeding.

History and geography content is integrated into reading passages rather than taught as separate standalone subjects, according to curriculum documentation. This integration approach develops reading comprehension skills while simultaneously teaching social studies content.

Third-party platforms include IXL (math concepts, spelling/grammar, science, social studies, foreign language), Khan Academy, Grammarly, Math Academy, and Synthesis Tutor. Proprietary applications include Alpha Math, AlphaRead (for older students reading instruction), AlphaWrite (writing instruction, though acknowledged as needing improvement per the Astral Codex Ten review), Teach Tales, and Fluency Coach. Younger students use third-party apps Amira and Lalio for reading instruction.

The central platform "Dash" analyzes each student's performance across applications and directs learners to appropriate lessons, creating a curated pathway through the multiple platforms based on individual needs and mastery levels.

While Alpha School follows Common Core standards K-8 and Advanced Placement curriculum at the high school level, detailed curriculum scope and sequence documents showing specific learning objectives by grade level are not publicly available. Specific foreign languages offered are not documented in public materials.

### Life Skills Program (Afternoon)

Alpha School's curriculum emphasizes 24 life skills organized across five core areas, taught through approximately four hours of afternoon workshops that are screen-free and hands-on:

**Five Core Life Skills Areas:**
1. **Teamwork & Leadership** - Collaboration, initiative, motivation
2. **Storytelling & Public Speaking** - Expression, audience connection, confidence
3. **Entrepreneurship & Financial Literacy** - Opportunity creation, money management
4. **Relationship Building & Socialization** - Positive relationships, social adaptation
5. **Grit & Hard Work** - Persistence, focus, growth from setbacks

The life skills curriculum follows age-appropriate progressions from PreK through high school. Example workshops include: "Picnic Planners" and "LEGO Master Builder" (PreK), "Fair Play Academy" and "Water for Life Project" (K-1), "Escape Room Expert" and "Alpha News Live" (grades 2-3), "Business Launch Pad" and "FBI Fitness Challenge" (grades 4-5), "Pirates & Sailing Crew" and "Startup Founder" (grades 6-8), and self-directed "super passion projects" spanning four years (high school).

According to Alpha School materials, students engage in real-world projects with measurable outcomes: fifth graders run profitable Airbnbs, fifth/sixth graders operate food trucks generating $4,000+ profit, second graders train for and run 5K races, and kindergarteners complete five-mile team bike races. These project examples come from Alpha's reporting without independent verification.

Life skills workshops receive systematic assessment through "Tests to Pass" events rather than participation-based grading. Direct instruction precedes practical application, and projects feature real consequences and measurable outcomes. Students advance through grade levels by completing individualized "Check Charts"—self-directed task lists including activities like escape rooms, puzzles, public speaking performances, typing speed achievements, and tournament participation.

PreK-8 students follow structured curriculum with systematic skill-building and prescribed workshop curricula. High school students engage in more self-directed learning with "super passion projects," dedicated mentorship, and student-sourced resources, providing greater autonomy in afternoon activities.

### Standards Alignment and Curriculum Sources

Alpha School's curriculum follows Common Core standards for grades K-8 and Advanced Placement (AP) curriculum at the high school level, as confirmed across multiple sources including the Modern Wisdom and Cognitive Revolution podcast interviews. However, detailed curriculum alignment documents showing how specific lessons map to standards are not publicly available.

The curriculum is delivered through a combination of third-party and proprietary platforms:

**Third-Party Platforms:**
- IXL - Core math instruction (new concepts), spelling/grammar, science, social studies, foreign language
- Khan Academy - Supplementary academic content
- Math Academy - Advanced math instruction
- Grammarly - Writing support
- Synthesis Tutor - Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Amira and Lalio - Reading instruction for younger students
- "Fast Math" - Math speed and accuracy practice on familiar material

**Proprietary Alpha Applications:**
- Alpha Math - Proprietary math platform
- AlphaRead - Reading instruction for older students
- AlphaWrite - Writing instruction (newly launched; acknowledged by Alpha School as needing improvement per Astral Codex Ten review)
- Teach Tales - Storytelling and literacy
- Fluency Coach - Reading fluency development

The central platform "Dash" (also referred to as the curriculum management layer of "Time Back") serves as the student dashboard where they click on buttons that take them directly to whichever adaptive application is appropriate for that student based on their current level and subject. Dash analyzes student performance data and curates the pathway through multiple applications, functioning as the recommendation and tracking system.

While specific foreign languages are mentioned as curriculum subjects, which languages are offered is not documented in public materials. Similarly, science curriculum details beyond "IXL-based science instruction" and social studies content beyond "integrated into reading passages" are not comprehensively described in available documentation.

No independent curriculum audit or third-party academic review of curriculum quality and standards alignment has been published or found in public materials.

### Assessment and Progression

Alpha School's curriculum uses both standardized external assessments and internal platform-based tracking to measure student progress and mastery.

**NWEA MAP Testing:**
Alpha School administers the NWEA MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) assessment three times yearly. MAP is an adaptive, nationally-normed test given to approximately 10 million U.S. students annually, measuring progress using RIT scores. According to Alpha School, students achieve school-level results on standardized tests "nearly always in the 99th percentile," and the school reports students learning 2.6 times faster than national norms, with the top two-thirds of students learning 3.6 times faster. Alpha School also claims that top performers achieve "up to 6.5x growth" on these assessments. All performance claims come from Alpha School's own reporting without independent third-party verification.

**Internal Mastery Assessments:**
The curriculum platform requires students to achieve the mastery threshold (over 90% or 80% depending on source and assessment type) to earn credit for daily lessons. Before advancing to the next grade level, students must pass comprehensive mastery tests covering full grade-level material. The system employs 100% multiple-choice testing, which the Astral Codex Ten review noted may not assess critical thinking or long-form analysis abilities.

**Real-Time Platform Tracking:**
The AI platform continuously monitors student performance through eye tracking and attention monitoring (per Astral Codex Ten review). Parents receive detailed performance insights via dashboards showing completion rates, problem accuracy, time spent on each subject, and projected advancement timelines. Mid-year updates show each child's growth trajectory.

**Level-Based vs. Age-Based Progression:**
Alpha School uses "levels that are based on specific capabilities as opposed to traditional grade models" (per FAQ). Students advance when they demonstrate mastery rather than on a calendar schedule, allowing faster learners to progress more quickly and ensuring slower learners achieve solid understanding before advancing. Students complete individualized "Check Charts" including academic milestones and life skills assessments to advance grade levels.

**Homework Policy:**
According to Alpha School FAQ, the curriculum is designed to be "so efficient that the traditional model of a six-hour school day plus homework becomes completely unnecessary." The goal is no homework, with all academic learning completed during the 2-hour morning block.

**High School Academic Performance:**
Alpha School reports a median SAT score of 1530 out of 1600 for recent seniors, with average freshman SAT scores of approximately 1410. The school also reports guaranteeing "1350+ SAT scores" by 8th grade for students entering in kindergarten (per GenWise Substack), though this claim warrants independent verification.

## Examples

### Mastery-Based Progression

**Scenario**: A student is working through a fractions unit and scores 65% on the mastery assessment.

**Traditional Approach**: In a traditional classroom, the student might receive a grade of 72% after partial credit and makeup work, "pass" the unit, and move on to decimals with significant knowledge gaps in fractions understanding.

**Alpha Approach**: The student scores 65% and does not advance. The AI platform identifies specific gaps in understanding (e.g., difficulty with equivalent fractions or fraction multiplication), provides targeted instruction on these precise concepts, and presents additional practice problems. The student continues working on fractions—receiving curated videos, problem sets, and immediate corrective feedback—until demonstrating 90%+ mastery across all fractions concepts. Only then does the platform allow advancement to decimals.

**Rationale**: While the Alpha student takes longer on fractions initially, preventing cumulative knowledge gaps enables faster ultimate learning. Understanding fractions at 90%+ proficiency makes decimals, percentages, ratios, and algebraic fractions significantly easier to master, as these concepts build directly on fraction understanding.

### Life Skills Workshop

**Workshop Name**: "Business Launch Pad" (grades 4-5)

**Structure**: According to Alpha School materials, fourth and fifth-grade students run actual profitable businesses such as operating an Airbnb property or launching a food truck. Students manage all aspects of the business including pricing strategy, customer communication, property or product maintenance, financial record-keeping, and profit-loss analysis.

**Real-World Outcomes**: Alpha reports that student-run food trucks have generated over $4,000 in profit, and student-managed Airbnb properties achieve profitability. Students learn entrepreneurship and financial literacy through direct experience with real consequences—poor customer service leads to negative reviews, pricing mistakes affect profitability, and operational failures have measurable impacts.

**Assessment**: The workshop culminates in "Tests to Pass" where students demonstrate mastery of entrepreneurship competencies through performance metrics: revenue generated, customer satisfaction ratings, problem-solving documentation, and presentation of business results to adult evaluators.

**Philosophy**: The life skills curriculum provides systematic assessment with real consequences and measurable outcomes, not participation-based advancement. Students receive direct instruction before practical application and develop competencies that traditional academics do not address.

### Curriculum Integration Example

**Traditional Approach**: History and social studies are taught as separate subjects with dedicated textbooks, lessons, and assessments distinct from reading/language arts instruction.

**Alpha Approach**: According to curriculum documentation, history and geography content is integrated into reading passages rather than taught as standalone disciplines. A student working on reading comprehension skills might read passages about the American Revolution, ancient civilizations, geographic regions, or historical events—simultaneously developing reading skills (vocabulary, inference, main idea identification) and learning social studies content.

**Rationale**: This integration approach leverages reading practice time to also deliver history and geography knowledge, contributing to the curriculum's claimed efficiency. Students develop content knowledge across disciplines while primarily advancing their reading comprehension capabilities.

**Limitation**: While this integration delivers factual knowledge, detailed scope and sequence for social studies content is not publicly documented, making it unclear whether students receive comprehensive, systematic coverage of history and geography standards beyond what appears in reading passages.
