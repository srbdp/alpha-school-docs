# Enrollment Process

> Alpha School's three-step enrollment pathway (Showcase → Application with \$100 fee → Shadow Day diagnostic assessment), level-based placement system using MAP exams, tuition ranging \$10,000-\$75,000/year by location with financial aid via Clarity software, rolling admissions with 5:1 student-guide ratio, required documentation (immunizations, records, waivers), and post-enrollment onboarding through Dean of Parents and ParentSquare platform.

## Overview

Alpha School uses a three-step enrollment process designed to match families with the school's learning model before commitment. Families attend Showcase events to explore the learning approach and environment. Interested families submit applications with a \$100 non-refundable fee per student. Admitted students participate in Shadow Day, experiencing a full day of AI-driven academics and afternoon workshops. Diagnostic assessments during Shadow Day (MAP/Measures of Academic Progress exams) determine level placement regardless of chronological grade. Alpha uses capability-based levels rather than traditional grade structure, meaning a 4th grade student might work at different levels across subjects based on mastery. Enrollment is finalized through enrollment forms, tuition agreements, and a \$1,000 deposit (applied toward tuition). Rolling admissions means no fixed deadlines, though capacity is limited to a 5:1 student-guide ratio.

Tuition varies significantly by location, reflecting Alpha's geographic market strategy. San Francisco charges \$75,000/year (the city's most expensive private school), Austin charges \$40,000/year, while Brownsville (near SpaceX headquarters) charges \$10,000/year. Micro-school model launches at approximately \$15,000/year. All tuition is all-inclusive, covering trips, activities, and supplies with "no additional fundraising ever" (per FAQ). Financial aid is available through Clarity (third-party software) calculating tuition assistance based on family financial information—though assistance is not guaranteed to every applicant. School vouchers (~\$12,000 in eligible states) can reduce micro-school costs to approximately \$300-400/month. Sibling discount offers 5% reduction for second child and beyond. Tuition information for several locations (New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale) is not publicly listed—families must contact specific campuses.

Required documentation before Shadow Day includes allergy/medication information, emergency contacts, current school records (grades 2-8), signed liability waivers, photo/video consent forms, and data collection forms. Post-Shadow Day, families meet with admissions coordinators to review MAP exam results and academic goals before finalizing enrollment. Additional requirements include physical exam forms and immunization certification per state mandates (Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Virginia). Post-enrollment onboarding connects families with the Dean of Parents and ParentSquare communication platform. INFORMATION GAPS: Specific enrollment deadlines are not disclosed (rolling admissions but capacity limits unknown), acceptance rates are not published, waitlist policies are not detailed, refund policy specifics were not found, mid-year enrollment policies are not public, income thresholds for financial aid eligibility are not disclosed, and exact tuition for multiple locations requires direct campus contact.

## Details

### Three-Step Enrollment Process

Alpha School's admissions follows a sequential pathway. **Step 1: Attend a Showcase** where families explore the learning approach and environment, typically at the campus location. **Step 2: Submit Application** including a completed application form and \$100 non-refundable fee per student (serves as initial commitment and screening). **Step 3: Shadow Day** where admitted students experience a full day engaging with AI academics and afternoon workshops while taking MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) diagnostic exams. The homepage directs interested families to the "Is Alpha a Fit?" assessment tool (https://match.app.alpha.school/) as a recommended first step before formal application. Post-Shadow Day, families meet with admissions coordinators to review MAP exam results and set academic goals. Enrollment is finalized by completing enrollment forms, tuition agreements, and submitting a \$1,000 enrollment deposit. The deposit applies toward overall tuition. Rolling admissions means families can apply throughout the year rather than during fixed application windows—a notable contrast to traditional private schools with set deadline periods. Capacity is managed through a 5:1 student-guide ratio, though total enrollment capacity per campus is not publicly disclosed. Contact methods include general email (registrar@alpha.school) or campus-specific contacts (e.g., Austin admissions: admissions@alpha.school, 512-358-1672).

### Eligibility and Placement System

Alpha serves K-12 students, with some locations offering PreK-12 (such as Alpha Austin). Eligibility is not based on admissions testing for minimum performance, but diagnostic assessments determine placement. Alpha uses a **level-based system founded on specific capabilities rather than traditional grade models**—a student's chronological grade does not dictate instructional level. Incoming students take MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) exams during Shadow Day. Placement is based on MAP assessment results regardless of current grade placement. A 4th grade student might work at 5th grade math level, 3rd grade reading level, and 4th grade science level depending on demonstrated mastery. This system allows students "two to three years behind" to catch up through accelerated learning (per outcomes research). Conversely, advanced students can progress beyond chronological grade level. Immunization requirements mandate all students comply with state-mandated immunizations or approved exemptions before enrollment (states with locations: Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Virginia). PreK 4 programs are available at select locations. Alpha Raleigh is launching Fall 2025, enrolling K-3 initially.

### Tuition Structure by Location

Alpha employs location-specific pricing strategy reflecting local market positioning. **San Francisco**: \$75,000/year (described as "city's most expensive private school," exceeding elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall at ~\$50,000/year). **Austin**: \$40,000/year (2024-2025). **GT School**: \$25,000/year (2024-2025). **Brownsville (Texas)**: \$10,000/year (lowest-cost location, near SpaceX headquarters). **Micro-schools**: launching at approximately \$15,000/year. **Total Range**: \$10,000-\$75,000 depending on location. Tuition for additional locations (New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale) is not publicly listed—families must contact the specific campus for pricing. **All-Inclusive Model**: Alpha tuition covers ALL student activities including trips (examples: Formula 1 events, Poland travel), supplies, and enrichment. Alpha explicitly states it will "never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" (per FAQ)—a differentiator from traditional private schools with add-on fees. **Sibling Discount**: 5% discount on tuition for second child and beyond. Tuition schedules (monthly/semester/annual payment options) are not detailed in public materials.

### Financial Aid and Affordability Strategies

**Tuition Assistance Program**: Available for the 2025-2026 school year and beyond. Alpha uses **Clarity** (third-party software) to collect family financial information and calculate possible tuition assistance amounts. **Important Limitation**: Tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant—award amounts and eligibility criteria are not publicly disclosed. **Income Thresholds**: Specific income limits or percentage-of-income formulas for aid eligibility are not public. **Voucher Strategy**: School vouchers (in eligible states) can significantly reduce family costs—example: ~\$12,000 vouchers applied to \$15,000 micro-school tuition reduces family cost to approximately \$300-400/month (\$3,600-\$4,800/year). This strategy is particularly effective in states with robust school choice programs. **Application Process**: Financial aid applications are processed through the Clarity platform. Specific deadlines for aid applications are not disclosed. The amount/percentage of families receiving aid is not published. **Named Scholarships**: No specific scholarship programs are named in public materials. **Gaps**: Income thresholds, award ranges, aid approval rates, and waitlist priority for aid recipients are not publicly documented.

### Application Requirements and Timeline

**Required Documentation Before Shadow Day**: (1) Allergy and medication information; (2) Emergency contact details; (3) Current school records for grades 2-8 students; (4) Signed liability waivers; (5) Photo and video consent forms; (6) Data collection forms. **Additional Requirements**: (1) Physical exam form; (2) Immunization certification per state requirements. **Fees**: (1) \$100 application fee per student (non-refundable)—due with application submission; (2) \$1,000 enrollment deposit—required to secure student's spot after acceptance, applies toward tuition. **Timeline Expectations**: Rolling admissions with no fixed deadlines. Shadow Day scheduling lead times are not specified. Acceptance decision timeline is not disclosed. Mid-year enrollment policies are not detailed. **Process Flow**: Application submission → Admissions review → Shadow Day invitation → Diagnostic testing → Coordinator meeting → Acceptance decision → Enrollment forms + deposit → Final documentation → Enrollment confirmed. **Information Not Public**: Specific application deadlines, acceptance rates, average time from application to decision, waitlist information, transfer student specific requirements, refund policy details.

### Post-Enrollment Onboarding and Community Integration

**Dean of Parents Support**: Enrolled families connect with the Dean of Parents—a role focused on parent community integration, addressing family questions, and supporting successful transition. **ParentSquare Platform**: All families set up ParentSquare communication platform—used for school announcements, teacher communication, event coordination, and community building. **Parent Community**: Emphasis on joining the parent community network for mutual support and engagement. **Academic Goals Setting**: Post-Shadow Day coordinator meetings establish initial academic goals based on MAP results—provides a roadmap for the student's learning trajectory. **MAP Results Review**: Families receive detailed breakdown of student's diagnostic assessment results, projected growth targets, and level placements across subjects. **First-Day Preparation**: Specific first-day preparation activities are not detailed in public materials. **Ongoing Communication**: Regular communication expectations between guides and families are not specified. **Parent Involvement**: The level of expected parent involvement (volunteering, events, conferences) is not detailed. **Additional Onboarding**: Whether orientation sessions, parent training, or student buddy systems exist is not documented.

## Examples

**Example 1: Austin Campus Enrollment Journey**: Parents of a 4th grade student attend an Alpha Austin showcase event learning about the 2-Hour Learning model and viewing campus facilities. The family decides to proceed and submits an online application with a \$100 application fee. The student is scheduled for Shadow Day two weeks later. During Shadow Day, the student participates in morning AI-driven academics (completing sample lessons on the platform) and afternoon workshops (robotics, art). The student takes MAP Reading, Math, and Language Usage assessments. Results show: Math at 5th grade level (RIT 220), Reading at 4th grade level (RIT 198), Language at 3rd grade level (RIT 190). The family meets with an admissions coordinator who explains level-based placement—the student will work at different levels per subject based on mastery rather than a single "4th grade" classification. The family reviews the \$40,000/year tuition for Austin campus and applies for tuition assistance through Clarity software. After acceptance and aid determination (specific amount not disclosed), the family submits the \$1,000 enrollment deposit (applied to tuition), completes immunization requirements, and signs the enrollment agreement. The family connects with the Dean of Parents and joins ParentSquare platform. The student begins at assigned levels with projected growth targets. INFORMATION STATUS: Process documented from public admissions page; specific timeline for acceptance decision not publicly disclosed; financial aid approval criteria and award amounts not detailed; Shadow Day scheduling lead time is example estimate.

**Example 2: Micro-School Enrollment with Voucher Strategy**: A family in a voucher-eligible state explores the Alpha micro-school option launching at \$15,000/year tuition. The family qualifies for a state school voucher program providing approximately \$12,000/year educational funding. The family attends a local showcase event and submits an application with a \$100 fee. The student participates in Shadow Day and completes MAP diagnostic assessments. Upon acceptance, the family applies the voucher to Alpha tuition: \$15,000 annual tuition - \$12,000 voucher = \$3,000 family responsibility (\$250/month or \$333/month depending on payment schedule). The family also receives a 5% sibling discount for a second child: Second child tuition \$15,000 × 0.95 = \$14,250 - \$12,000 voucher = \$2,250 family responsibility (\$187.50/month). Total family cost for two children: approximately \$437.50/month. The all-inclusive model means no additional costs for field trips, supplies, or activities. The family submits the enrollment deposit and completes required documentation. INFORMATION STATUS: Voucher amounts are examples from research citing "~\$12,000 vouchers"; actual voucher amounts vary by state and program; micro-school tuition documented at "approximately \$15,000/year"; specific payment schedule options not publicly detailed.

**Example 3: Financial Aid Application Process**: A family interested in Alpha San Francisco (\$75,000/year) is unable to afford full tuition. The family submits an enrollment application with a \$100 fee. The student completes Shadow Day and receives acceptance. The family applies for tuition assistance through Alpha's Clarity platform—uploads tax returns, income statements, asset information, and household expense documentation. Clarity software calculates an estimated family contribution based on financial data. Alpha admissions reviews the Clarity recommendation and determines an aid award (specific formula and criteria not public). The family receives notification of a tuition assistance offer—hypothetical example: \$75,000 tuition - \$30,000 aid = \$45,000 family responsibility. The family must decide whether to accept the offer and submit the \$1,000 enrollment deposit or decline. LIMITATION: This example uses a hypothetical aid amount as Alpha does not publish aid ranges, approval rates, income thresholds, or award formulas; actual process confirmed through research but specific outcomes vary by family; tuition assistance "NOT guaranteed to every applicant" per Alpha materials; no published data on percentage of families receiving aid or average award amounts.

## FAQs

**Q: What are the steps to enroll my child at Alpha School?**

A: Alpha uses a three-step process: (1) Attend a Showcase event to explore the learning model and campus environment; (2) Submit an application online with a \$100 non-refundable application fee per student; (3) Participate in Shadow Day where your child experiences a full day of AI academics and afternoon workshops while taking MAP diagnostic assessments. After Shadow Day, you'll meet with admissions coordinators to review MAP results and academic goals. If accepted and you decide to enroll, complete enrollment forms and tuition agreement, then submit a \$1,000 enrollment deposit (applies toward tuition). Final steps include immunization documentation and connecting with the Dean of Parents and ParentSquare platform. Alpha operates rolling admissions so families can apply throughout the year, though capacity is limited by the 5:1 student-guide ratio.

**Q: How much does Alpha School cost and is financial aid available?**

A: Tuition varies significantly by location: San Francisco charges \$75,000/year, Austin charges \$40,000/year, GT School charges \$25,000/year, and Brownsville charges \$10,000/year. Micro-schools launch at approximately \$15,000/year. All tuition is all-inclusive—covering trips, activities, and supplies with no additional fundraising requests. Financial aid is available through Clarity (third-party software) that calculates tuition assistance based on family financial information, though assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant. Families can also use school vouchers (~\$12,000 in eligible states) to reduce costs—potentially bringing micro-school tuition to \$300-400/month. Sibling discount offers 5% reduction for second child and beyond. Specific tuition for some locations (New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale) requires contacting the campus directly as pricing is not publicly listed.

**Q: What are the eligibility requirements for Alpha School?**

A: Alpha serves K-12 students (PreK-12 at some locations like Austin). There are no publicly disclosed admissions testing minimums for acceptance. However, Alpha uses a level-based system based on specific capabilities rather than traditional grade models. During Shadow Day, students take MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) diagnostic assessments which determine placement levels across subjects. A 4th grade student might work at different levels for math, reading, and science based on demonstrated mastery rather than chronological grade. All students must comply with state-mandated immunization requirements or approved exemptions. Rolling admissions means families can apply anytime, though acceptance rates and waitlist policies are not publicly disclosed.

**Q: What documentation do I need to enroll my child?**

A: Before Shadow Day, you'll need: allergy/medication information, emergency contacts, current school records (for grades 2-8), signed liability waivers, photo/video consent forms, and data collection forms. Additionally, you'll need a physical exam form and immunization certification per state requirements (Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Virginia). Financial documents are needed if applying for tuition assistance through Clarity. After acceptance, you'll complete enrollment forms, tuition agreement, and submit the \$1,000 enrollment deposit. The application itself requires a \$100 non-refundable fee per student.

**Q: How does Alpha's level-based placement work?**

A: Alpha does not use traditional grade-based instruction. Instead, students work at different "levels" based on demonstrated capability in each subject. During Shadow Day, incoming students take MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) exams in reading, math, and language usage. Results determine starting levels regardless of chronological grade—a 6th grade student might work at 7th grade math, 5th grade reading, and 6th grade science simultaneously. Students progress by demonstrating 90%+ mastery on assessments before advancing to the next level. This approach allows students who are behind to catch up through accelerated learning and advanced students to progress beyond grade level. After Shadow Day, families meet with admissions coordinators to review MAP results and understand specific level placements and projected growth targets.
