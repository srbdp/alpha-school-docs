# Tuition

> Alpha School's location-based tuition pricing ranges from &#36;10,000/year (Brownsville) to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco), with an all-inclusive model covering all trips, activities, and supplies without additional fundraising; 5% sibling and $10,000 founding family discounts apply; &#36;100 application fee and &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit (applied to tuition) required.

## Overview

Alpha School employs a location-based pricing strategy with tuition ranging from &#36;10,000/year to &#36;75,000/year depending on campus location and local market positioning. San Francisco represents the highest tier at &#36;75,000/year for the 2025-2026 school year, described as the "city's most expensive private school," exceeding elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall at approximately &#36;50,000/year. Austin charges &#36;40,000/year for the 2025-2026 school year, GT School charges &#36;25,000/year, and Brownsville (near SpaceX headquarters in Texas) offers the lowest-cost option at &#36;10,000/year. Enrollment requires a &#36;100 non-refundable application fee per student and a &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit which applies toward tuition.

Alpha operates an all-inclusive tuition model differentiating from traditional private schools with add-on fees. Tuition covers ALL student activities including field trips (examples: Formula 1 events, Poland travel), supplies, enrichment programs, and activities. Alpha explicitly states they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ. Sibling discounts offer a 5% reduction on tuition for the second child and beyond. The first 25 families at a new location receive a $10,000 per child founding family discount for 5 years. Alpha has a monthly payment option, spreading the tuition payment over 10 months. For mid-year enrollments, the tuition will be pro-rated accordingly.

Financial aid is available through Clarity (third-party software platform) at the Austin location for families earning less than $200,000. Tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant. School vouchers (approximately &#36;12,000 in eligible states with robust school choice programs) can significantly reduce family costs when applied to lower-tier tuition locations. Voucher availability and amounts vary by state, student circumstances, and program requirements. Voucher strategy is particularly effective in states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona with established school choice infrastructure. Families pursuing financial aid apply through the Clarity platform though specific application deadlines and decision timelines are not publicly documented.

## Details

### Tuition by Location

Alpha School's pricing reflects a geographic market strategy. **San Francisco**: &#36;75,000/year (2025-2026), positioned as the "city's most expensive private school" exceeding traditional elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall (~&#36;50,000/year), reflects the competitive private school market and high cost of living. **Austin, Texas**: &#36;40,000/year (2025-2026), mid-tier pricing for flagship location with 159 students (PK, K-8). **GT School**: &#36;25,000/year (2025-2026), in Georgetown, Texas. **Brownsville, Texas**: &#36;10,000/year, the lowest-cost Alpha location positioned near SpaceX headquarters, serves families in lower-income border region. **New York**: $65,000, **Miami**: $55,000, **Santa Barbara**: $50,000, **Scottsdale**: $40,000, tuition for other locations can be found on alpha.school website. **Alpha High School**: $40,000$. **Pricing Updates**: Tuition amounts reflect 2025-2026 school years; future year pricing not guaranteed; families should verify current tuition with specific campus during application process.

### All-Inclusive Model and What Tuition Covers

Alpha School differentiates from traditional private schools through a comprehensive all-inclusive tuition model. **What's Included**: ALL student activities without exception including field trips (examples documented: Formula 1 race events, international travel to Poland), supplies (no supply lists or fees), enrichment programs, afternoon workshops, sports and physical activities, arts programming, technology and equipment, learning platform access, and MAP diagnostic assessments. **No Additional Fundraising**: Alpha explicitly guarantees they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ—distinguishes from traditional private schools with annual giving campaigns, gala fundraisers, classroom supply requests, and activity surcharges. **No Hidden Fees**: Tuition covers the complete educational experience without add-ons—families can budget precisely without unexpected mid-year costs. **Comparisons**: Traditional private schools often charge base tuition (&#36;30,000-&#36;50,000) plus mandatory fees (technology &#36;500-&#36;2,000, capital improvements &#36;1,000-&#36;5,000), optional trips (&#36;500-&#36;5,000), supplies (&#36;200-&#36;500), sports/activities (&#36;500-&#36;2,000), and annual fund expectations (&#36;1,000-&#36;10,000)—Alpha's model consolidates all costs into a single tuition figure. **What's NOT Included**: Meals/lunch are offered at an additional fee, before/after-school care, transportation, optional summer programs, specialized tutoring beyond standard instruction. **Value Proposition**: The all-inclusive model provides cost certainty and eliminates the fundraising burden on families.

### Fees and Deposits

**Application Fee**: &#36;100 per student, non-refundable, required at application submission, serves as initial financial commitment and administrative cost recovery. **Enrollment Deposit**: &#36;1,000 per student, required to secure enrollment spot after acceptance, APPLIES TOWARD overall tuition (not an additional cost), holds student's place while enrollment is finalized. **Timing**: Application fee paid with application; enrollment deposit due after acceptance. **Refundability**: Application fee is explicitly non-refundable; enrollment deposit refund policy not publicly documented—unclear if refundable before school year starts, after certain date, or non-refundable entirely. **Additional Fees**: No other mandatory fees (registration, technology, capital, etc.)—consistent with all-inclusive model. **Total Enrollment Cost**: Application fee (&#36;100) + Tuition (location-specific) = Total first-year cost; enrollment deposit reduces first tuition payment by &#36;1,000. **Example**: Austin enrollment total cost = &#36;100 application fee + &#36;40,000 tuition - &#36;1,000 deposit credit = &#36;39,100 net first-year cost plus &#36;100 fee. Alpha offers rolling enrollment throughout the year. **INFORMATION GAPS**: Refund policy conditions, replacement fees for lost materials.

### Financial Aid Process and Limitations

**Clarity Platform**: Alpha uses Clarity (third-party financial aid software) to collect family financial information and calculate possible tuition assistance amounts. **Application Requirements**: Families submit tax returns, income statements, asset documentation, household expense information, and other financial data through the Clarity portal. **Aid Determination**: Clarity software analyzes financial information and generates a recommended tuition assistance amount; Alpha admissions reviews the Clarity recommendation and makes final aid award decisions. **CRITICAL LIMITATION**: Tuition assistance is offered at the Austin location only to famnilies earning less than $200,000, and is NOT guaranteed to every applicant—award availability is subject to institutional budget, applicant pool, and financial need assessment. **Undisclosed Details**: Percentage of tuition covered by typical awards not disclosed, total percentage of families receiving aid not published, average award amounts not documented, priority criteria for aid allocation not detailed, renewable aid expectations for subsequent years not explained. **Application Timeline**: Financial aid application deadlines not specified (rolling admissions suggests continuous evaluation); decision timeline not documented. **Notification**: How and when families receive aid decisions not detailed; whether families can appeal aid decisions not addressed. **Multiple Children**: Sibling discount (5%) applies after other discounts and financial aid calculation.

### School Vouchers and Affordability Strategies

**Voucher Compatibility**: Alpha School accepts state-funded school vouchers in eligible states with school choice programs—vouchers apply directly to tuition reducing family out-of-pocket costs. **Typical Voucher Amounts**: Research indicates approximately &#36;12,000/year vouchers in states with robust school choice programs (examples: Texas, Florida, Arizona); actual amounts vary by state, grade level, student circumstances (special needs may receive higher amounts), and program year. **Voucher Eligibility**: Varies by state—some programs are universal (all students eligible), others are income-restricted, some require prior public school enrollment, special needs vouchers have different criteria. **States with School Choice Programs**: Texas (Education Savings Accounts), Florida (multiple programs including FES, FTC), Arizona (ESA program), others expanding. **Application Process**: Families typically apply for vouchers through state programs separate from Alpha enrollment—Alpha assists with documentation but does not control eligibility. **Strategic Combination**: Vouchers can combine with sibling discounts. **Voucher Limitations**: Amounts may not cover full tuition at higher-tier locations (San Francisco &#36;75,000 - &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;63,000 remaining); voucher programs subject to state legislative changes, funding availability, and political dynamics. **GAPS**: Specific voucher programs accepted by each Alpha location, whether Alpha qualifies for special needs vouchers, voucher payment schedules (direct to school vs. family reimbursement).

### Sibling Discount

**Discount Structure**: 5% tuition reduction for second child and all subsequent children—applies to each additional child's tuition. **Calculation Example**: First child pays full tuition (e.g., &#36;40,000 Austin), second child receives 5% discount (&#36;40,000 × 0.95 = &#36;38,000), third child also receives 5% discount (&#36;38,000). **Total Family Savings**: Two children at Austin = &#36;40,000 + &#36;38,000 = &#36;78,000 (saves &#36;2,000 vs. &#36;80,000); three children = &#36;40,000 + &#36;38,000 + &#36;38,000 = &#36;116,000 (saves &#36;4,000 vs. &#36;120,000). **Comparison with Vouchers**: Sibling discount (5% = &#36;2,000 on Austin tuition) is significantly smaller than voucher value (~&#36;12,000); families using vouchers see greater cost reduction than sibling discount alone. **Combined Strategies**: Sibling discount + vouchers = maximum affordability—example: Second child micro-school tuition &#36;15,000 × 0.95 = &#36;14,250, minus &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;2,250 family cost. **Eligibility**: Discount applies when multiple children are enrolled simultaneously; if one child graduates, the discount is no longer applicable. **Application**: Automatic when multiple children are enrolled. Discount combines with financial aid and is applied after any financial aid and other discounts; there is no limit on the number of children eligible for the sibling discount.

### Founding Family Discount

**Discount Structure**: &#36;10,000 tuition reduction for each child for the first five years of tuition. **Application**: Automatic to the first twenty-five families enrolling at any location. Discount combines with financial aid and other discounts; there is no limit on the number of children eligible for the sibling discount.

## Examples

**Example 1: San Francisco Full-Pay Family**: Family enrolls one child at Alpha San Francisco for 2025-2026 school year. Tuition: &#36;75,000/year. Application fee: &#36;100 (non-refundable). Enrollment deposit: &#36;1,000 (applies to tuition). Total first-year cost: &#36;100 application fee + &#36;1,000 deposit &#36;74,000 remaining tuition = &#36;75,100 total. The all-inclusive model means &#36;74,100 covers EVERYTHING: AI-driven academics, afternoon workshops, field trips (Formula 1 events, international travel), supplies, enrichment, sports, arts, technology, MAP assessments. No additional costs throughout the year—no fundraising asks, no supply fees, no trip charges, no activity surcharges. Family does not qualify for financial aid and does not pursue vouchers. COMPARISON: Traditional San Francisco private schools like Convent & Stuart Hall charge approximately &#36;50,000 tuition plus typical additional costs (technology fees &#36;1,500, capital fund &#36;3,000, annual giving expectation &#36;5,000, trip/activity fees &#36;2,000, supplies &#36;500) = approximately &#36;62,000 total. Alpha at &#36;75,000 represents approximately &#36;13,000 premium but eliminates fundraising participation and cost uncertainty. INFORMATION STATUS: San Francisco tuition (&#36;75,000) documented on https://alpha.school/san-francisco/; all-inclusive model confirmed in Alpha FAQ; comparison schools' pricing from public sources..

**Example 2: Austin Family with Sibling Discount**: Family enrolls two children at Alpha Austin (&#36;40,000/year tuition). First child tuition: &#36;40,000/year. Second child tuition with 5% sibling discount: &#36;40,000 × 0.95 = &#36;38,000/year. Total family cost for TWO children: &#36;40,000 + &#36;38,000 = &#36;78,000/year or &#36;7,800 with the monthly payment plan. Enrollment costs: &#36;100 application fee per child (&#36;200 total) + &#36;1,000 deposit per child (&#36;2,000 total, both apply to tuition). First-year total: &#36;200 fees + &#36;78,000 net tuition = &#36;78,200 for two children receiving the full Alpha experience. INFORMATION STATUS: Tuition (~&#36;40,000) documented in research; sibling discount (5%) confirmed in enrollment materials; monthly cost estimates based on typical 10-month payment schedules; voucher application process separate from Alpha enrollment.

## FAQs

**Q: How much does Alpha School cost?**

A: Alpha School tuition varies significantly by location, ranging from &#36;10,000/year (Brownsville, Texas) to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco). Specific pricing: San Francisco &#36;75,000, Austin &#36;40,000, GT School &#36;25,000, Brownsville &#36;10,000. For other locations (New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale, etc.) review the https://alpha.school/ website. All tuition is all-inclusive—covering trips, activities, supplies, enrichment, and everything else with no additional fundraising ever. Enrollment also requires a &#36;100 non-refundable application fee per student and &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit (which applies toward tuition). The significant &#36;65,000 variance between lowest and highest locations reflects Alpha's geographic market positioning strategy.

**Q: What does Alpha tuition include?**

A: Alpha operates an all-inclusive tuition model where the stated tuition covers ALL student activities without exception. This includes: field trips (examples documented include Formula 1 race events and international travel to Poland), supplies (no supply lists or fees), enrichment programs, afternoon workshops, sports and physical activities, arts programming, technology and equipment, learning platform access, and MAP diagnostic assessments. Alpha explicitly states they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ. This differentiates Alpha from traditional private schools which often charge base tuition plus mandatory fees (technology, capital improvements), optional trip charges, supply fees, activity surcharges, and annual giving campaign expectations. The all-inclusive model provides cost certainty—families can budget the stated tuition figure without unexpected mid-year costs.

**Q: Is financial aid available and how do I apply?**

A: Yes, financial aid is available at the Austin location for the 2025-2026 school year to families with incomes below $200,000, though tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant. Alpha uses Clarity (third-party software) to process financial aid applications. To apply: submit your enrollment application, complete Shadow Day, receive acceptance, then apply through Clarity's platform by uploading tax returns, income statements, asset documentation, and household expense information. Clarity calculates a recommended tuition assistance amount which Alpha admissions reviews to make final aid award decisions. IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS: Award ranges are not published, approval rates are not documented, and specific application deadlines are not specified (rolling admissions suggests continuous evaluation). The percentage of families receiving aid and average award amounts are also not public information.

**Q: Can I use school vouchers at Alpha School?**

A: Yes, Alpha School accepts state-funded school vouchers in eligible states with school choice programs. Vouchers apply directly to tuition, significantly reducing family out-of-pocket costs. Research indicates typical voucher amounts of approximately &#36;12,000/year in states with robust school choice programs (examples: Texas, Florida, Arizona), though actual amounts vary by state, grade level, and student circumstances. Voucher eligibility varies by state—some programs are universal (all students eligible), others are income-restricted or require prior public school enrollment. Families typically apply for vouchers through state programs separate from Alpha enrollment, though Alpha can assist with documentation.

**Q: Is there a sibling discount?**

A: Yes, Alpha offers a 5% tuition discount for the second child and all subsequent children enrolled simultaneously. For example: if the first child pays full tuition of &#36;40,000 at Austin, the second child receives 5% off (&#36;40,000 × 0.95 = &#36;38,000), saving the family &#36;2,000. For three children, the savings would be &#36;4,000 total. The sibling discount can combine with school vouchers for maximum affordability—example: second child at a &#36;15,000 micro-school receives 5% discount (&#36;14,250), then applies a &#36;12,000 voucher, resulting in just &#36;2,250 family cost. However, details not publicly documented include: whether the discount applies to fees/deposits or only tuition, if the percentage increases with more children, how it combines with financial aid calculations, and maximum children eligible.

**Q: What are the enrollment fees and deposits?**

A: Alpha requires two fees for enrollment: (1) &#36;100 application fee per student—non-refundable, paid when submitting the application, covers administrative costs; (2) &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit per student—required to secure the student's spot after acceptance, APPLIES TOWARD overall tuition (not an additional cost). For example, enrolling at Austin: &#36;100 application fee + &#36;40,000 tuition - &#36;1,000 deposit credit = net first-year cost of &#36;39,100 plus the &#36;100 fee. The application fee is explicitly non-refundable. The enrollment deposit's refund policy is not publicly documented—it's unclear if it's refundable before the school year starts, after certain dates, or non-refundable entirely. No other mandatory fees are documented (registration, technology, capital, etc.), consistent with Alpha's all-inclusive model.
