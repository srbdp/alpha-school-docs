# Tuition and Financial Aid

> Alpha School's location-based tuition pricing ranges from &#36;45,000/year to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco), with an all-inclusive model covering all trips, activities, and supplies without additional fundraising; financial aid available via Clarity platform (NOT guaranteed to all applicants); 5% sibling discounts apply; &#36;100 application fee and &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit (applied to tuition) required.

## Overview

Alpha School employs a location-based pricing strategy with tuition ranging from &#36;45,000/year to &#36;75,000/year depending on campus location and local market positioning. San Francisco represents the highest tier at &#36;75,000/year for the 2025-2026 school year, described as the "city's most expensive private school," exceeding elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall at approximately &#36;50,000/year. Austin charges &#36;40,000/year for the 2024-2025 school year, GT School charges &#36;25,000/year, and Brownsville (near SpaceX headquarters in Texas) offers the lowest-cost option at &#36;10,000/year. The micro-school model launches at approximately &#36;15,000/year. Several locations including New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, and Scottsdale do not publicly list tuition—families must contact the specific campus for pricing. Enrollment requires a &#36;100 non-refundable application fee per student and a &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit which applies toward tuition.

Alpha operates an all-inclusive tuition model differentiating from traditional private schools with add-on fees. Tuition covers ALL student activities including field trips (examples: Formula 1 events, Poland travel), supplies, enrichment programs, and activities. Alpha explicitly states they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ. Sibling discounts offer a 5% reduction on tuition for the second child and beyond. Payment schedule options (monthly, semester, annual) are not detailed in public materials. INFORMATION GAPS: Specific payment plan structures, late payment policies, refund policies for withdrawal, mid-year enrollment pro-rating, and financial obligations beyond stated tuition are not publicly documented.

Financial aid is available through Clarity (third-party software platform) which calculates tuition assistance based on family financial information including tax returns, income statements, asset documentation, and household expenses. CRITICAL LIMITATION: Tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant. Income thresholds, award ranges, approval rates, and eligibility formulas are not publicly disclosed. School vouchers (approximately &#36;12,000 in eligible states with robust school choice programs) can significantly reduce family costs when applied to lower-tier tuition locations. Example: &#36;15,000 micro-school tuition minus &#36;12,000 voucher equals &#36;3,000 annual family cost (approximately &#36;300-400/month depending on payment schedule). Voucher availability and amounts vary by state, student circumstances, and program requirements. Voucher strategy is particularly effective in states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona with established school choice infrastructure. Families pursuing financial aid apply through the Clarity platform though specific application deadlines and decision timelines are not publicly documented.

## Details

### Tuition by Location

Alpha School's pricing reflects a geographic market strategy with seven disclosed pricing tiers and several undisclosed locations. **San Francisco**: &#36;75,000/year (2025-2026), positioned as the "city's most expensive private school" exceeding traditional elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall (~&#36;50,000/year), reflects the competitive private school market and high cost of living. **Austin, Texas**: &#36;40,000/year (2024-2025), mid-tier pricing for flagship location with 155 students (PK, K-8). **GT School**: &#36;25,000/year (2024-2025), specific location details not extensively documented. **Brownsville, Texas**: &#36;10,000/year, the lowest-cost Alpha location positioned near SpaceX headquarters, serves families in lower-income border region. **Micro-schools**: Launching at approximately &#36;15,000/year, smaller-format Alpha locations targeting residential communities and suburban markets. **Undisclosed Locations**: New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale, and potentially other locations require direct campus contact for pricing—tuition not published on public-facing materials. **Alpha High School**: Pricing not separately disclosed, may differ from K-8 model. **Pricing Updates**: Tuition amounts reflect 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years; future year pricing not guaranteed; families should verify current tuition with specific campus during application process. **Geographic Strategy**: The &#36;65,000 variance between lowest (Brownsville &#36;10,000) and highest (San Francisco &#36;75,000) reflects Alpha's approach to market-based pricing rather than uniform national tuition.

### All-Inclusive Model and What Tuition Covers

Alpha School differentiates from traditional private schools through a comprehensive all-inclusive tuition model. **What's Included**: ALL student activities without exception including field trips (examples documented: Formula 1 race events, international travel to Poland), supplies (no supply lists or fees), enrichment programs, afternoon workshops, sports and physical activities, arts programming, technology and equipment, learning platform access, and MAP diagnostic assessments. **No Additional Fundraising**: Alpha explicitly guarantees they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ—distinguishes from traditional private schools with annual giving campaigns, gala fundraisers, classroom supply requests, and activity surcharges. **No Hidden Fees**: Tuition covers the complete educational experience without add-ons—families can budget precisely without unexpected mid-year costs. **Comparisons**: Traditional private schools often charge base tuition (&#36;30,000-&#36;50,000) plus mandatory fees (technology &#36;500-&#36;2,000, capital improvements &#36;1,000-&#36;5,000), optional trips (&#36;500-&#36;5,000), supplies (&#36;200-&#36;500), sports/activities (&#36;500-&#36;2,000), and annual fund expectations (&#36;1,000-&#36;10,000)—Alpha's model consolidates all costs into a single tuition figure. **What's NOT Included**: Meals/lunch (not explicitly addressed in materials), before/after-school care (if offered, costs not documented), transportation (not mentioned), optional summer programs (not detailed), specialized tutoring beyond standard instruction (not addressed). **Value Proposition**: The all-inclusive model provides cost certainty and eliminates the fundraising burden on families.

### Fees and Deposits

**Application Fee**: &#36;100 per student, non-refundable, required at application submission, serves as initial financial commitment and administrative cost recovery. **Enrollment Deposit**: &#36;1,000 per student, required to secure enrollment spot after acceptance, APPLIES TOWARD overall tuition (not an additional cost), holds student's place while enrollment is finalized. **Timing**: Application fee paid with application; enrollment deposit due after acceptance and enrollment decision. **Refundability**: Application fee is explicitly non-refundable; enrollment deposit refund policy not publicly documented—unclear if refundable before school year starts, after certain date, or non-refundable entirely. **Additional Fees**: No other mandatory fees documented (registration, technology, capital, etc.)—consistent with all-inclusive model. **Total Enrollment Cost**: Application fee (&#36;100) + Tuition (location-specific) = Total first-year cost; enrollment deposit reduces first tuition payment by &#36;1,000. **Example**: Austin enrollment total cost = &#36;100 application fee + &#36;40,000 tuition - &#36;1,000 deposit credit = &#36;39,100 net first-year cost plus &#36;100 fee. **INFORMATION GAPS**: Payment deadlines for deposit, refund policy conditions, late enrollment fee policies, replacement fees for lost materials.

### Financial Aid Process and Limitations

**Clarity Platform**: Alpha uses Clarity (third-party financial aid software) to collect family financial information and calculate possible tuition assistance amounts. **Application Requirements**: Families submit tax returns, income statements, asset documentation, household expense information, and other financial data through the Clarity portal. **Aid Determination**: Clarity software analyzes financial information and generates a recommended tuition assistance amount; Alpha admissions reviews the Clarity recommendation and makes final aid award decisions. **CRITICAL LIMITATION**: Tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant—award availability is subject to institutional budget, applicant pool, and financial need assessment. **Undisclosed Details**: Income thresholds for eligibility not public, percentage of tuition covered by typical awards not disclosed, total percentage of families receiving aid not published, average award amounts not documented, priority criteria for aid allocation not detailed, renewable aid expectations for subsequent years not explained. **Application Timeline**: Financial aid application deadlines not specified (rolling admissions suggests continuous evaluation); decision timeline not documented. **Notification**: How and when families receive aid decisions not detailed; whether families can appeal aid decisions not addressed. **Multiple Children**: Whether sibling discount (5%) applies before or after financial aid calculation not clarified. **Gaps**: Full cost of attendance beyond tuition (if any), expected family contribution formulas, need-based vs. merit-based criteria, named scholarship opportunities.

### School Vouchers and Affordability Strategies

**Voucher Compatibility**: Alpha School accepts state-funded school vouchers in eligible states with school choice programs—vouchers apply directly to tuition reducing family out-of-pocket costs. **Typical Voucher Amounts**: Research indicates approximately &#36;12,000/year vouchers in states with robust school choice programs (examples: Texas, Florida, Arizona); actual amounts vary by state, grade level, student circumstances (special needs may receive higher amounts), and program year. **Cost Reduction Example**: &#36;15,000 micro-school tuition - &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;3,000 annual family cost (approximately &#36;300-400/month depending on payment schedule)—represents an 80% cost reduction. **Voucher Eligibility**: Varies by state—some programs are universal (all students eligible), others are income-restricted, some require prior public school enrollment, special needs vouchers have different criteria. **States with School Choice Programs**: Texas (Education Savings Accounts), Florida (multiple programs including FES, FTC), Arizona (ESA program), others expanding. **Application Process**: Families typically apply for vouchers through state programs separate from Alpha enrollment—Alpha assists with documentation but does not control eligibility. **Strategic Combination**: Vouchers can combine with sibling discounts—example: Second child at &#36;15,000 micro-school receives 5% discount (&#36;14,250) then applies &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;2,250 family cost. **Voucher Limitations**: Amounts may not cover full tuition at higher-tier locations (San Francisco &#36;75,000 - &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;63,000 remaining); voucher programs subject to state legislative changes, funding availability, and political dynamics. **GAPS**: Specific voucher programs accepted by each Alpha location, whether Alpha qualifies for special needs vouchers, voucher payment schedules (direct to school vs. family reimbursement).

### Sibling Discounts and Family Affordability

**Discount Structure**: 5% tuition reduction for second child and all subsequent children—applies to each additional child's tuition. **Calculation Example**: First child pays full tuition (e.g., &#36;40,000 Austin), second child receives 5% discount (&#36;40,000 × 0.95 = &#36;38,000), third child also receives 5% discount (&#36;38,000). **Total Family Savings**: Two children at Austin = &#36;40,000 + &#36;38,000 = &#36;78,000 (saves &#36;2,000 vs. &#36;80,000); three children = &#36;40,000 + &#36;38,000 + &#36;38,000 = &#36;116,000 (saves &#36;4,000 vs. &#36;120,000). **Comparison with Vouchers**: Sibling discount (5% = &#36;2,000 on Austin tuition) is significantly smaller than voucher value (~&#36;12,000); families using vouchers see greater cost reduction than sibling discount alone. **Combined Strategies**: Sibling discount + vouchers = maximum affordability—example: Second child micro-school tuition &#36;15,000 × 0.95 = &#36;14,250, minus &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;2,250 family cost. **Eligibility**: Discount applies when multiple children are enrolled simultaneously; unclear if discount applies when one child graduates and another is still enrolled. **Application**: Likely automatic when multiple children are enrolled, but application process not documented. **GAPS**: Whether discount applies to application fees, enrollment deposits, or only tuition; if discount percentage increases with more children (e.g., 5% for second, 10% for third); if discount combines with financial aid or is applied before aid calculation; maximum number of children eligible for discount; specific terms and conditions.

## Examples

**Example 1: San Francisco Full-Pay Family**: Family enrolls one child at Alpha San Francisco for 2025-2026 school year. Tuition: &#36;75,000/year. Application fee: &#36;100 (non-refundable). Enrollment deposit: &#36;1,000 (applies to tuition). Total first-year cost: &#36;100 application fee + (&#36;75,000 tuition - &#36;1,000 deposit credit) = &#36;74,100 net tuition cost plus &#36;100 fee = &#36;74,200 total. The all-inclusive model means &#36;74,200 covers EVERYTHING: AI-driven academics, afternoon workshops, field trips (Formula 1 events, international travel), supplies, enrichment, sports, arts, technology, MAP assessments. No additional costs throughout the year—no fundraising asks, no supply fees, no trip charges, no activity surcharges. Family does not qualify for financial aid and does not pursue vouchers. COMPARISON: Traditional San Francisco private schools like Convent & Stuart Hall charge approximately &#36;50,000 tuition plus typical additional costs (technology fees &#36;1,500, capital fund &#36;3,000, annual giving expectation &#36;5,000, trip/activity fees &#36;2,000, supplies &#36;500) = approximately &#36;62,000 total. Alpha at &#36;74,200 represents approximately &#36;12,000 premium but eliminates fundraising participation and cost uncertainty. INFORMATION STATUS: San Francisco tuition (&#36;75,000) documented in SF Standard article; all-inclusive model confirmed in Alpha FAQ; comparison schools' pricing from public sources; payment schedule (monthly/semester/annual options) not documented.

**Example 2: Micro-School Family with Voucher and Sibling Discount**: Family in Texas enrolls two children at Alpha micro-school. First child tuition: &#36;15,000/year. Second child tuition with 5% sibling discount: &#36;15,000 × 0.95 = &#36;14,250/year. Family qualifies for Texas Education Savings Account vouchers: approximately &#36;12,000 per child. First child net cost: &#36;15,000 - &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;3,000/year (approximately &#36;250-300/month depending on payment plan). Second child net cost: &#36;14,250 - &#36;12,000 voucher = &#36;2,250/year (approximately &#36;187.50-225/month). Total family cost for TWO children: &#36;3,000 + &#36;2,250 = &#36;5,250/year (approximately &#36;437.50-525/month). Enrollment costs: &#36;100 application fee per child (&#36;200 total) + &#36;1,000 deposit per child (&#36;2,000 total, both apply to tuition). First-year total: &#36;200 fees + &#36;5,250 net tuition = &#36;5,450 for two children receiving the full Alpha experience. Voucher strategy reduces effective tuition from &#36;29,250 (combined before discounts/vouchers) to &#36;5,250 (82% reduction). INFORMATION STATUS: Micro-school tuition (~&#36;15,000) and voucher amounts (~&#36;12,000) documented in research; sibling discount (5%) confirmed in enrollment materials; monthly cost estimates based on typical 10-month payment schedules; specific payment plan options not publicly detailed; voucher application process separate from Alpha enrollment.

**Example 3: Austin Family with Financial Aid**: Family enrolls one child at Alpha Austin (&#36;40,000/year tuition). Family cannot afford full tuition and applies for financial aid through the Clarity platform. Application process: (1) Submit enrollment application with &#36;100 fee; (2) Student completes Shadow Day and receives acceptance; (3) Family applies for aid via Clarity—uploads tax returns showing household income, asset statements, expense documentation; (4) Clarity calculates recommended tuition assistance amount based on financial algorithm (formula not public); (5) Alpha admissions reviews Clarity recommendation and determines final award. HYPOTHETICAL AWARD SCENARIO: Family receives &#36;18,000 tuition assistance award (45% of tuition). Net family cost: &#36;40,000 - &#36;18,000 aid = &#36;22,000/year. Enrollment deposit: &#36;1,000 (applies to net &#36;22,000). Actual first-year cost: &#36;100 application fee + (&#36;22,000 - &#36;1,000 deposit credit) = &#36;21,100 net plus &#36;100 fee = &#36;21,200 total. Family pays &#36;21,200 for the all-inclusive Alpha experience (no additional costs). CRITICAL LIMITATION: This example uses HYPOTHETICAL aid amount (&#36;18,000) as Alpha does not publish aid ranges, approval rates, income thresholds, or award formulas; actual awards vary significantly by family financial profile; tuition assistance NOT guaranteed—application does not ensure award; specific income limits for eligibility not disclosed; percentage of applicants receiving aid not published; whether aid is renewable for subsequent years not documented. INFORMATION STATUS: Austin tuition (&#36;40,000) documented in tuition PDF; Clarity platform confirmed for aid applications; award amount, approval likelihood, and eligibility criteria are HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES based on typical private school aid patterns, not Alpha-specific published data.

## FAQs

**Q: How much does Alpha School cost?**

A: Alpha School tuition varies significantly by location, ranging from &#36;10,000/year (Brownsville, Texas) to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco). Specific pricing: San Francisco &#36;75,000, Austin &#36;40,000, GT School &#36;25,000, Brownsville &#36;10,000, and micro-schools approximately &#36;15,000. Several locations (New York, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale) require contacting the specific campus for pricing as tuition is not publicly listed. All tuition is all-inclusive—covering trips, activities, supplies, enrichment, and everything else with no additional fundraising ever. Enrollment also requires a &#36;100 non-refundable application fee per student and &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit (which applies toward tuition). The significant &#36;65,000 variance between lowest and highest locations reflects Alpha's geographic market positioning strategy.

**Q: What does Alpha tuition include?**

A: Alpha operates an all-inclusive tuition model where the stated tuition covers ALL student activities without exception. This includes: field trips (examples documented include Formula 1 race events and international travel to Poland), supplies (no supply lists or fees), enrichment programs, afternoon workshops, sports and physical activities, arts programming, technology and equipment, learning platform access, and MAP diagnostic assessments. Alpha explicitly states they "will never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising" per their FAQ. This differentiates Alpha from traditional private schools which often charge base tuition plus mandatory fees (technology, capital improvements), optional trip charges, supply fees, activity surcharges, and annual giving campaign expectations. The all-inclusive model provides cost certainty—families can budget the stated tuition figure without unexpected mid-year costs.

**Q: Is financial aid available and how do I apply?**

A: Yes, financial aid is available for the 2025-2026 school year and beyond, though tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed to every applicant. Alpha uses Clarity (third-party software) to process financial aid applications. To apply: submit your enrollment application, complete Shadow Day, receive acceptance, then apply through Clarity's platform by uploading tax returns, income statements, asset documentation, and household expense information. Clarity calculates a recommended tuition assistance amount which Alpha admissions reviews to make final aid award decisions. IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS: Income thresholds for eligibility are not publicly disclosed, award ranges are not published, approval rates are not documented, and specific application deadlines are not specified (rolling admissions suggests continuous evaluation). The percentage of families receiving aid and average award amounts are also not public information.

**Q: Can I use school vouchers at Alpha School?**

A: Yes, Alpha School accepts state-funded school vouchers in eligible states with school choice programs. Vouchers apply directly to tuition, significantly reducing family out-of-pocket costs. Research indicates typical voucher amounts of approximately &#36;12,000/year in states with robust school choice programs (examples: Texas, Florida, Arizona), though actual amounts vary by state, grade level, and student circumstances. For example: a family using a &#36;12,000 voucher at a &#36;15,000 micro-school location would pay approximately &#36;3,000/year (about &#36;300-400/month), representing an 80% cost reduction. Voucher eligibility varies by state—some programs are universal (all students eligible), others are income-restricted or require prior public school enrollment. Families typically apply for vouchers through state programs separate from Alpha enrollment, though Alpha can assist with documentation.

**Q: Is there a sibling discount?**

A: Yes, Alpha offers a 5% tuition discount for the second child and all subsequent children enrolled simultaneously. For example: if the first child pays full tuition of &#36;40,000 at Austin, the second child receives 5% off (&#36;40,000 × 0.95 = &#36;38,000), saving the family &#36;2,000. For three children, the savings would be &#36;4,000 total. The sibling discount can combine with school vouchers for maximum affordability—example: second child at a &#36;15,000 micro-school receives 5% discount (&#36;14,250), then applies a &#36;12,000 voucher, resulting in just &#36;2,250 family cost. However, details not publicly documented include: whether the discount applies to fees/deposits or only tuition, if the percentage increases with more children, how it combines with financial aid calculations, and maximum children eligible.

**Q: What are the enrollment fees and deposits?**

A: Alpha requires two fees for enrollment: (1) &#36;100 application fee per student—non-refundable, paid when submitting the application, covers administrative costs; (2) &#36;1,000 enrollment deposit per student—required to secure the student's spot after acceptance, APPLIES TOWARD overall tuition (not an additional cost). For example, enrolling at Austin: &#36;100 application fee + &#36;40,000 tuition - &#36;1,000 deposit credit = net first-year cost of &#36;39,100 plus the &#36;100 fee. The application fee is explicitly non-refundable. The enrollment deposit's refund policy is not publicly documented—it's unclear if it's refundable before the school year starts, after certain dates, or non-refundable entirely. No other mandatory fees are documented (registration, technology, capital, etc.), consistent with Alpha's all-inclusive model.
