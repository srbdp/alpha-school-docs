# Locations Expansion Plans

> Publicly announced expansion plans and strategic growth initiatives for Alpha School's campus network

## Overview

Alpha School is undergoing rapid national expansion driven by strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Following the July 2025 strategic partnership with Guidepost Montessori and acquisition of key assets from Higher Ground Education, Alpha has accelerated its growth timeline by approximately two years. The organization plans to open multiple new campuses in Fall 2026 across major metropolitan areas, complementing its current network of 17 operating campuses across 8 states.

The expansion strategy focuses on high-demand markets in major metropolitan areas and affluent suburbs, leveraging three growth mechanisms: strategic partnerships (co-location with existing educational facilities), acquisitions (converting closed Guidepost Montessori campuses), and organic development. This multi-pronged approach has enabled Alpha to reduce the typical 1-2 year timeline for new campus openings and fast-track expansion across diverse geographic markets.

Alpha School also operates specialty programs under its umbrella, including Texas Sports Academy, which offers sport-specific learning environments combining athletic training with Alpha's two-hour AI-powered academic model. These specialty schools are expanding rapidly across Texas, with multiple openings planned for January and Fall 2026.

### Strategic Partnerships Driving Expansion

Alpha School's rapid expansion has been enabled by two major strategic partnerships announced in July 2025:

#### Guidepost Montessori Partnership (July 2025)

Alpha School formed a strategic partnership with Guidepost Montessori to accelerate expansion through co-location and facility sharing:

- **Purpose**: Open K-3 elementary micro schools in existing Guidepost facilities
- **Impact**: Fast-tracked opening of 10 new K-8 campuses by December 2025
- **Timeline Reduction**: Reduced typical 1-2 year new school opening timeline
- **Locations Enabled**: Charlotte NC, Raleigh NC, Folsom CA, Palm Beach FL, Chantilly VA, Lake Forest CA, Austin TX, Plano TX

The partnership allows Alpha to leverage existing educational facilities and operational infrastructure, dramatically accelerating geographic expansion without the delays of facility acquisition and buildout.

#### Higher Ground Education Acquisition (July 2025)

In July 2025, Alpha School agreed to acquire key assets from Higher Ground Education, the former parent company of Guidepost Montessori:

- **Assets Acquired**: Proprietary elementary educational materials and rights to select high-value campuses from closed Guidepost schools
- **Timeline Impact**: Accelerated Alpha's growth timeline by approximately two years
- **First Campus Result**: San Francisco campus (opened August 2025 at former Guidepost Fort Mason facility)
- **Strategic Value**: Enabled immediate entry into premium markets with established facilities

### Geographic Expansion Strategy

Alpha School's expansion strategy demonstrates clear patterns in market selection and entry approaches:

**Geographic Focus**:
- **Major Metropolitan Areas**: New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami
- **Affluent Suburban Markets**: Scottsdale, Palo Alto, Santa Monica, The Woodlands, Chantilly (DC area)
- **Regional Distribution**: Expanding across Sunbelt (Texas, Florida, Arizona) and high-income coastal markets (California, New York)
- **Tuition Positioning**: Higher tuition in coastal/urban markets (&#36;65,000-&#36;75,000) vs. lower in Sunbelt (&#36;40,000-&#36;50,000)

**Market Entry Approaches**:
1. **Partnerships**: Co-location with Guidepost Montessori facilities (Chantilly, Charlotte, Raleigh, Lake Forest, Palm Beach)
2. **Acquisitions**: Converting closed Guidepost campuses (San Francisco)
3. **Organic Development**: New campus development in existing markets (Austin expansion to three separate campuses)

**Timeline Acceleration**:
- **Original Growth Pace**: 1-2 years per new campus opening
- **Post-Partnership Pace**: 10 new K-8 campuses within 6 months (July-December 2025)
- **Overall Acceleration**: Approximately 2 years ahead of original timeline due to strategic M&A

This multi-pronged expansion approach allows Alpha to enter new markets quickly while maintaining quality standards through established facility partnerships.

### Other Specialty Programs

Alpha School operates additional specialty programs beyond Texas Sports Academy, though limited public information is available:

- **GT School**
- **Montessorium**
- **NextGen Academy**
- **Nova Academy**
- **Waypoint Academy**
- **Alpha Anywhere** (online/remote learning option)

**INFORMATION STATUS**: These program names are mentioned on Alpha School's website and in public sources, but detailed information about their educational models, locations, enrollment, or expansion plans is not publicly available.

## Examples

### Example 1: Bay Area Expansion Driven by Demand

Following the August 2025 opening of Alpha School's San Francisco campus (at &#36;75,000/year tuition), demand in the Bay Area has driven plans for two additional campuses:

- **Palo Alto, CA** (Fall 2026) - Silicon Valley market entry
- **East Bay, CA** (exploratory) - Eastern Bay Area expansion

This expansion pattern demonstrates Alpha's strategy of entering premium markets with initial flagship campuses, then expanding regionally based on demonstrated demand.

### Example 2: Partnership-Enabled Rapid Deployment (Raleigh)

The Raleigh, NC campus illustrates how the Guidepost Montessori partnership accelerated expansion:

- **Announced**: July 2025 (as part of partnership)
- **Opened**: January 2026 (6 months from announcement)
- **Model**: K-6 grades (K-5 at launch, expanding annually)
- **Initial Enrollment**: 25 students for inaugural class
- **Location**: 12600 Spruce Tree Way, Raleigh, NC 27614 (North Raleigh)

Traditional school openings typically require 1-2 years from announcement to opening; the Guidepost partnership reduced this timeline by over 50%.

### Example 3: Texas Sports Academy Multi-Sport Expansion

Texas Sports Academy's January 2026 expansion demonstrates Alpha's ability to simultaneously launch multiple specialty campuses:

- **3 locations opening simultaneously** (Baseball-Pearland, Basketball-Houston, Gymnastics-San Antonio)
- **3 different sports** (Baseball, Basketball, Gymnastics)
- **4 different cities** (when including Fall 2026 Cheer-Lago Vista)
- **Consistent model**: Grades 4-8, &#36;15,000 tuition, Texas ESA-eligible

This coordinated multi-location launch suggests operational capability for rapid specialty program scaling beyond traditional Alpha School campuses.

## FAQs

**Q: When will Alpha School open in [specific city]?**

A: For Fall 2026, Alpha School has publicly announced openings in five locations: The Woodlands TX, Dorado Puerto Rico, Palo Alto CA, Santa Monica CA, and Chicago IL. Several other cities (Aspen CO, Houston TX, Orlando FL, Phoenix AZ, East Bay CA) are listed as areas being "explored" but do not have confirmed opening dates. For the most current expansion timeline, check alpha.school/locations or contact Alpha School directly.

**Q: How does the Guidepost Montessori partnership work?**

A: The July 2025 strategic partnership allows Alpha School to open K-3 elementary micro schools in existing Guidepost Montessori facilities. This co-location model enables Alpha to use established educational facilities, reducing the typical 1-2 year timeline for new campus openings. Examples include the Chantilly VA campus, which operates inside a Guidepost location alongside that Montessori school.

**Q: What is Texas Sports Academy and how is it related to Alpha School?**

A: Texas Sports Academy is a specialty program operated under the Alpha School umbrella that combines sport-specific athletic training with Alpha's two-hour AI-powered academic model. Students focus intensively on a single sport (basketball, baseball, gymnastics, cheer) while completing academic coursework using Alpha's platform. Texas Sports Academy campuses serve grades 4-8 at &#36;15,000/year tuition (with Texas ESA program potentially covering ~&#36;10,300). The program is expanding across Texas with 4 new locations opening in January and Fall 2026.

**Q: How quickly is Alpha School expanding?**

A: Alpha School's expansion accelerated significantly in 2025. Through the Guidepost Montessori partnership and Higher Ground Education acquisition (both July 2025), Alpha fast-tracked the opening of 10 new K-8 campuses by December 2025 and accelerated its overall growth timeline by approximately two years. The organization grew from its founding Austin campus in 2016 to 17 operating campuses across 8 states by early 2026, with at least 5 additional campuses planned for Fall 2026.

**Q: Are all announced expansion locations confirmed or are some still exploratory?**

A: Alpha School distinguishes between confirmed openings and exploratory targets. **Confirmed Fall 2026 openings** (with public announcements): The Woodlands TX, Dorado Puerto Rico, Palo Alto CA, Santa Monica CA, Chicago IL. **Exploratory targets** (mentioned as areas of interest without confirmed dates): Aspen CO, Houston TX, Orlando FL, Phoenix AZ, East Bay CA. Always verify the current status of any specific location at alpha.school/locations, as expansion plans can change.

**Q: How has the Higher Ground Education acquisition affected expansion?**

A: The July 2025 acquisition of key assets from Higher Ground Education (former parent of Guidepost Montessori) accelerated Alpha's growth by approximately two years. The acquisition included proprietary elementary educational materials and rights to select high-value campuses from closed Guidepost schools. The first campus resulting from this acquisition was San Francisco, which opened in August 2025 at the former Guidepost Fort Mason facility. This acquisition enabled Alpha to enter premium markets with established facilities rather than building from scratch.
