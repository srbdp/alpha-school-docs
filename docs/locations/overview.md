### Standard Campus Features and Operations

All Alpha School campuses follow a consistent operational model regardless of location:

**Operating Hours**: 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM daily with drop-off window 8:15-8:30 AM and pick-up window 3:30-4:00 PM.

**Academic Model**: Two-hour AI-powered personalized learning block using mastery-based progression where students advance upon demonstrating 90%+ competency in core subjects (reading, math, language, science, social studies).

**Afternoon Programming**: Life skills workshops including leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, public speaking, coding, and science labs.

**Outdoor Play**: Minimum 60-90 minutes daily (weather permitting) emphasizing physical activity and unstructured play.

**Staffing Model**: "Guides" who act as mentors/coaches rather than traditional lecture-based teachers, maintaining a 5:1 student-guide ratio across the network.

**Pedagogical Approach**: No homework, no traditional letter/number grades, capability-based levels rather than grade-based classes.

**All-Inclusive Tuition**: Covers trips (examples: Formula 1 events, Poland travel), supplies, and enrichment activities with a "no additional fundraising ever" policy distinguishing Alpha from traditional schools with add-on fees.

**Remote Option**: Alpha Anywhere provides online/remote learning for families not near a physical campus.

**Campus Leadership**: Typically includes Head Guide and Dean of Parents roles managing student instruction and family community integration respectively.

**Expansion Strategy**: Geographic diversification across high-income markets (Palo Alto, Santa Monica, East Bay) and newer markets (Puerto Rico, Tampa). Tuition positioning likely follows local market strategy: premium markets command &#36;65,000-&#36;75,000 (San Francisco model), mid-tier markets &#36;40,000-&#36;55,000 (Austin/Charlotte model), and strategic low-cost entries &#36;10,000-&#36;15,000 (Brownsville/Texas Sports Academy model).

**Community-Driven Expansion**: The website mentions "Bring Alpha To Your City" suggesting interest-driven expansion beyond announced targets.

**INFORMATION GAPS**: Specific opening dates within "Fall 2026" timeframe, leadership/staffing plans for new locations, enrollment capacity targets, and facility specifications are not publicly available.

## Examples

**Example 1: Austin Flagship Campus Experience**

A family lives in South Austin near the Barton Springs area and explores Alpha School for their 3rd grade child. They visit the Austin flagship campus at 1201 Spyglass Drive—a 10 minute drive from their home via MoPac. The campus, located in the Barton Hills neighborhood near Zilker Park, provides a familiar Austin environment. The family observes 150+ students engaged in a two-hour morning AI learning block with guides circulating to provide support. Campus features include outdoor play areas where students spend a minimum of 1 hour 15 minutes daily. The family learns the campus was established in 2016 (Year 11 of operation) and holds Cognia accreditation. Tuition is quoted at &#36;40,000/year for the 2024-2025 academic year—all-inclusive covering field trips, supplies, and enrichment with no additional fundraising requests. Hours align with the family's work schedule: drop-off 8:15-8:30 AM, pick-up 3:30-4:00 PM. The family contacts admissions at (512) 595-0801 or admissions.austin@alpha.school to schedule a Shadow Day.

INFORMATION STATUS: Austin flagship details documented from alpha.school/austin page and research sources; 150+ enrollment confirmed in public materials; Cognia accreditation verified; tuition from published materials; campus count (3 Austin locations: PreK-5, 6-8, 9-12) indicates vertical progression pathway within Austin market enabling students to remain in Alpha network through high school graduation.

**Example 2: Geographic Expansion Comparison - Brownsville vs. San Francisco**

Alpha School operates campuses in Brownsville TX and San Francisco CA, illustrating extreme tuition variance and market positioning strategy. **Brownsville Campus**: 591 N. Central Ave, Brownsville, TX 78521, serves PreK-8 students at &#36;10,000/year tuition (lowest in network); located near SpaceX headquarters in a border region with lower cost of living; &#36;10,000 tuition positions Alpha competitively against local private schools while remaining accessible to families with ESA vouchers or financial aid; the campus demonstrates Alpha's willingness to serve lower-income markets with adjusted pricing. **San Francisco Campus**: 3741 Buchanan St, San Francisco, CA 94123 (Marina/Fort Mason area), serves K-10 students at &#36;75,000/year tuition (highest in network); opened August 2025 as the 14th Alpha campus in a former Guidepost Montessori Fort Mason facility acquired through the Higher Ground Education asset deal; SF Standard described it as the "most expensive private school in the city," exceeding elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall (~&#36;50,000/year); &#36;75,000 tuition reflects San Francisco premium market positioning and high operational costs. Both campuses follow an identical operational model (8:15 AM - 4:00 PM, two-hour AI learning, 60-90 minutes outdoor play, life skills workshops, guides vs. teachers, no homework) despite the &#36;65,000 tuition difference. The tuition variance reflects local market conditions and family willingness-to-pay rather than a differentiated educational product.

INFORMATION STATUS: Tuition figures from research sources; Brownsville near SpaceX detail from research/locations.md; San Francisco opening date and facility history from PR Newswire and news sources; SF Standard comparison to Convent & Stuart Hall documented; identical operational model across network confirmed in standard features documentation.

**Example 3: Texas Sports Academy Multi-Location Model**

A family in the Houston area has a 6th grade child excelling in competitive baseball and seeking an academic program compatible with intensive training schedules. The family explores The Bennett School (Texas Sports Academy baseball campus) at 2626 W. Sam Houston Parkway N., Houston, TX 77043, serving grades 7-10. The school combines Alpha's two-hour AI-powered learning block with afternoon baseball-specific training, enabling student-athletes to accelerate academics while dedicating significant time to sport development. Tuition is quoted at &#36;15,000/year—significantly lower than standard Alpha campuses (&#36;40,000-&#36;75,000), reflecting the targeted market and specialized focus. The family learns that the Texas ESA program may provide approximately &#36;10,300 per student, reducing family cost to ~&#36;4,700/year. Since their child is currently in 6th grade, the family plans enrollment for the following year when entering 7th grade (minimum grade for The Bennett School). The family also considers the newly opened January 2026 baseball campus in Pearland, TX (18500 Pearland Sites Road, grades 4-8), which offers an earlier entry point. The model enables the child to complete core academics in the morning two-hour block (reading, math, language, science, social studies via AI platform with mastery-based progression) then transition to baseball training, strength/conditioning, and game strategy in the afternoon hours. If the child later decides to pursue a different path or reduce sport intensity, they can transfer to a standard Alpha campus (Houston area has multiple Alpha/specialty locations). The Texas Sports Academy network includes basketball (Round Rock, Houston locations), gymnastics (San Antonio), and cheer (Lago Vista Fall 2026), providing sport-specific pathways across Texas markets.

INFORMATION STATUS: The Bennett School details from research/locations.md citing Community Impact article; &#36;15,000 tuition and grade levels documented; Texas ESA ~&#36;10,300 figure from research sources; January 2026 Pearland opening from research; two-hour learning block + sport training model inferred from Alpha's standard academic structure applied to specialty school context; transfer flexibility between Alpha campuses represents logical operational capability though not explicitly documented in public materials.

A: All Alpha School campuses follow the same educational model—two-hour AI-powered personalized learning block, mastery-based progression, afternoon life skills workshops, 60-90 minutes outdoor play, 5:1 student-guide ratio, and 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM schedule. The primary differences are: (1) Tuition varies by location from &#36;10,000/year (Brownsville TX) to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco CA), reflecting local market positioning; (2) Grade levels served differ—Santa Barbara is the only K-12 campus, while others range from K-5 to K-10; (3) Facility features vary based on location (Scottsdale has a full basketball court and three playgrounds, Fort Worth operates within the CERA recreational facility); (4) Campus size and enrollment capacity differ, though only Austin flagship confirms 150+ students publicly.

**Q: Where is Alpha School's flagship campus and what makes it unique?**

A: Alpha School's flagship campus is located at 1201 Spyglass Drive, Austin, TX 78746 in the Barton Hills neighborhood. Established in 2016, it represents the founding location (Year 11 of operation as of 2026, though MacKenzie Price started the concept in 2014). The campus serves PreK-5 students with over 150 currently enrolled, holds Cognia accreditation (the only campus with confirmed accreditation in public materials), and charges &#36;40,000/year tuition. It's considered the organizational prototype that established the two-hour learning model, mastery-based progression system, and guide-based staffing approach now used across all Alpha locations. Austin also serves as corporate headquarters for Legacy of Education, Inc. (Alpha's legal name).

**Q: What are the Texas Sports Academy locations and how are they different from regular Alpha School campuses?**

A: Texas Sports Academy operates sport-specific schools that combine Alpha's two-hour AI-powered learning block with intensive athletic training at &#36;15,000/year tuition (lower than standard Alpha campuses). Currently operating: AIE Elite Prep basketball in Round Rock (grades 5-8), The Bennett School baseball in Houston (grades 7-10). Opened January 2026: baseball in Pearland (grades 4-8), basketball in Houston (grades 4-8), gymnastics in San Antonio (grades 4-8). Opening Fall 2026: cheer in Lago Vista (grades 5-8). Students complete core academics in the morning two-hour block then transition to sport-specific training in afternoon hours. The Texas ESA program may provide approximately &#36;10,300 per student toward the &#36;15,000 tuition, potentially reducing family cost to ~&#36;4,700/year.

**Q: What are Alpha School's expansion plans?**

A: Alpha School has announced 5 new campuses opening Fall 2026: The Woodlands TX (&#36;40,000 tuition), Dorado Puerto Rico (&#36;50,000), Palo Alto CA (tuition TBD), Santa Monica CA (tuition TBD), and Chicago IL (tuition TBD). Additionally, Alpha is exploring expansion in Aspen CO, Houston TX, Orlando FL, Phoenix AZ, and East Bay CA, though these lack confirmed opening dates. The rapid expansion is enabled by Alpha's July 2025 strategic partnership with Guidepost Montessori and acquisition of Higher Ground Education assets, which accelerated the growth timeline by approximately 2 years. Alpha's website also mentions "Bring Alpha To Your City," suggesting community-driven expansion interest beyond announced targets.

**Q: Can my family choose any Alpha School location or do we have to attend the closest campus?**

A: Families can apply to any Alpha School campus regardless of proximity, as there are no publicly disclosed geographic enrollment restrictions. However, practical considerations apply: (1) Campus hours are 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM with drop-off 8:15-8:30 AM and pick-up 3:30-4:00 PM, requiring families to handle daily transportation; (2) Tuition varies significantly by location (&#36;10,000-&#36;75,000/year), so families may prefer campuses with pricing matching their budget even if farther away; (3) Some campuses explicitly note service areas (Fort Worth serves "Aledo, Tanglewood, Ridglea, Arlington, Keller, Southlake, Colleyville," suggesting broader geographic draw); (4) Transportation options like busing or carpool coordination are not detailed in public materials except for Fort Worth carpool mention, suggesting families are primarily responsible for daily transport; (5) Rolling admissions and the 5:1 student-guide ratio mean capacity limits may affect availability at the desired campus.
