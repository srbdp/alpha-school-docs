## Overview

Alpha School operates 17 campuses across 8 states as of January 2026, headquartered in Austin, Texas under legal name Legacy of Education, Inc. The network spans Texas (6 campuses: Austin PreK-5 flagship, Austin 6-8 middle school, Austin High 9-12, Brownsville PreK-8, Fort Worth K-8, Plano K-5), Arizona (1 campus: Scottsdale K-8), California (3 campuses: Lake Forest K-5, San Francisco K-10, Santa Barbara K-12), Florida (3 campuses: Miami K-10, Palm Beach K-5, Tampa K-9), New York (1 campus: NYC K-8), Virginia (1 campus: Chantilly K-6), and North Carolina (2 campuses: Charlotte K-6, Raleigh K-6). The founding campus, established in 2016 in Austin's Barton Hills neighborhood, currently serves 150+ students and holds Cognia accreditation. The most recent opening, Raleigh NC, launched January 2026 with 25 students in its inaugural class. Grade levels served vary by campus from K-5 (Lake Forest, Palm Beach, Plano) to full K-12 (Santa Barbara is the only location offering a complete PreK-12 pathway). Tuition ranges from &#36;10,000/year (Brownsville, near SpaceX headquarters) to &#36;75,000/year (San Francisco, described as the city's most expensive private school). All campuses follow a standardized operational model: 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM schedule, two-hour AI-powered personalized learning block, mastery-based progression, afternoon life skills workshops, minimum 60-90 minutes outdoor play daily, and guides (mentors/coaches) rather than traditional teachers.

Campus facilities and features vary by location but share core characteristics. The Austin flagship campus (1201 Spyglass Dr) near MoPac and Zilker Park provides comprehensive facilities for over 150 students. The Scottsdale campus (20624 N 76th St) features a full basketball court, three playground structures, a gaga pit, and football field-sized open space near Greyhawk Park. The Fort Worth location (3300 Bryant Irvin Rd) operates within the CERA recreational facility, accessing racquetball courts, gymnasium, and expansive fields. The Miami campus (8000 SW 56th St) near Tropical Park serves the Palmetto Bay, Pinecrest, Coral Gables, and Brickell areas. The San Francisco campus (3741 Buchanan St) operates in the Marina/Fort Mason area at a former Guidepost Montessori facility opened August 2025. The New York City campus (180 Maiden Lane) occupies a prestigious Lower Manhattan building opened September 3, 2025. Some campuses operate alongside or within existing facilities—Chantilly operates inside a Guidepost Montessori location at 4550 Walney Road. Contact information varies by campus, with flagship Austin reachable at (512) 595-0801 / admissions.austin@alpha.school, Fort Worth at (817) 330-9327 / admissions.fortworth@alpha.school, Miami at (786) 864-0687 / admissions.miami@alpha.school, and Scottsdale at (480) 253-9802 / admissions.scottsdale@alpha.school. Alpha also operates specialty schools under its umbrella brand including GT School, Montessorium, NextGen Academy, Nova Academy, Texas Sports Academy, and Waypoint Academy.

Rapid expansion accelerated through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In July 2025, Alpha announced a partnership with Guidepost Montessori to open K-3 elementary micro-schools in 9 new locations, fast-tracking 10 new K-8 campuses by December 2025 and reducing the typical 1-2 year opening timeline. The same month, Alpha acquired key assets from Higher Ground Education (former Guidepost parent company) including proprietary elementary materials and rights to select high-value campuses from closed Guidepost schools, accelerating growth by approximately 2 years. Texas Sports Academy operates sport-specific schools at &#36;15,000/year tuition including AIE Elite Prep basketball (Round Rock), The Bennett School baseball (Houston), with January 2026 openings for baseball (Pearland), basketball (Houston), gymnastics (San Antonio), and a Fall 2026 cheer program (Lago Vista). Expansion plans for Fall 2026 include The Woodlands TX (&#36;40,000), Dorado Puerto Rico (&#36;50,000), Palo Alto CA (tuition TBD), Santa Monica CA (tuition TBD), and Chicago IL (tuition TBD), with additional exploration targets in Aspen CO, Houston TX, Orlando FL, Phoenix AZ, and East Bay CA. INFORMATION GAPS: Specific enrollment capacity per campus is not publicly disclosed (only Austin confirms 150+), square footage/facility capacity details are unavailable, accreditation status is unknown for non-Austin campuses, transportation options are not detailed except for Fort Worth carpool coordination, before/after school care availability is not documented, waitlist information is not public, and historical opening dates for older campuses beyond Austin are not specified.

### Standard Campus Features and Operations

All Alpha School campuses follow a consistent operational model regardless of location:

**Operating Hours**: 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM daily with drop-off window 8:15-8:30 AM and pick-up window 3:30-4:00 PM.

**Academic Model**: Two-hour AI-powered personalized learning block using mastery-based progression where students advance upon demonstrating 90%+ competency in core subjects (reading, math, language, science, social studies).

**Afternoon Programming**: Life skills workshops including leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, public speaking, coding, and science labs.

**Outdoor Play**: Minimum 60-90 minutes daily (weather permitting) emphasizing physical activity and unstructured play.

**Staffing Model**: "Guides" who act as mentors/coaches rather than traditional lecture-based teachers, maintaining a 5:1 student-guide ratio across the network.

**Pedagogical Approach**: No homework, no traditional letter/number grades, capability-based levels rather than grade-based classes.

**All-Inclusive Tuition**: Covers trips (examples: Formula 1 events, Poland travel), supplies, and enrichment activities with a "no additional fundraising ever" policy distinguishing Alpha from traditional schools with add-on fees.

**Remote Option**: Alpha Anywhere provides online/remote learning for families not near a physical campus.

**Campus Leadership**: Typically includes Head Guide and Dean of Parents roles managing student instruction and family community integration respectively.

### Flagship Austin Campus Details

The original Alpha School campus, established in 2016 at 1201 Spyglass Drive, Austin, TX 78746, serves PreK-5 students and represents the founding location and organizational prototype.

**Enrollment**: Over 150 students currently enrolled (only campus with publicly disclosed enrollment).

**Operational History**: Year 11 of operation as of 2026 (marking 10 years since 2016 establishment, though MacKenzie Price started the concept in 2014).

**Accreditation**: Cognia accredited (only campus with confirmed accreditation status in public materials).

**Location Context**: Barton Hills neighborhood near MoPac highway and Zilker Park, providing access to Austin outdoor recreation.

**Contact**: (512) 595-0801 primary phone, admissions.austin@alpha.school for enrollment inquiries.

**Hours**: 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM (drop-off 8:15-8:30 AM, pick-up 3:30-4:00 PM).

**Academic Features**: Two-hour AI-powered personalized learning block, mastery-based progression system, ranked in "top 1% nationally" for academic performance (per Alpha materials).

**Afternoon Programming**: Life skills workshops covering leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy.

**Physical Activity**: Minimum 1 hour 15 minutes outdoor play daily.

**Tuition**: &#36;40,000/year (2024-2025 academic year).

**Additional Austin Locations**: Alpha operates three Austin campuses—PreK-5 flagship (Spyglass), 6-8 middle school (201 Colorado St downtown), and 9-12 Alpha High (same downtown address). The downtown campuses share the 201 Colorado St address, suggesting vertical grade-level separation within the facility. Austin market positioning reflects mid-range tuition (&#36;40,000) between the Brownsville low-cost model (&#36;10,000) and San Francisco premium positioning (&#36;75,000).

### Specialty Schools and Programs

Alpha School operates multiple specialty schools under its umbrella organizational structure:

**Texas Sports Academy**: Sport-specific schools combining Alpha's two-hour learning model with intensive athletic training at &#36;15,000/year tuition.

**Currently Open**:
- AIE Elite Prep basketball in Round Rock, TX (2400 Chisholm Trail Road, grades 5-8)
- The Bennett School baseball in Houston, TX (2626 W. Sam Houston Parkway N., grades 7-10)

**Opened January 2026**:
- Baseball in Pearland, TX (18500 Pearland Sites Road Bldg. D, grades 4-8)
- Basketball in Houston, TX (11275 S. Sam Houston Parkway W., grades 4-8)
- Gymnastics in San Antonio, TX (14242 Cross Canyon, grades 4-8)

**Opening Fall 2026**:
- Cheer in Lago Vista, TX (grades 5-8, specific address pending)

**Financial Context**: Texas ESA (Education Savings Account) program may provide approximately &#36;10,300 per student toward the &#36;15,000 tuition, reducing family cost to ~&#36;4,700/year.

**Other Specialty Schools**: GT School (&#36;25,000/year tuition documented for 2024-2025), Montessorium, NextGen Academy, Nova Academy, and Waypoint Academy—specific details, locations, and grade levels for these programs are not documented in public materials.

**Program Philosophy**: Specialty schools maintain Alpha's core two-hour AI learning block while tailoring afternoon programming to sport or focus area. The Texas Sports Academy model enables student-athletes to accelerate academics in the morning block while dedicating afternoon hours to elite-level sport training.

### Strategic Growth and Partnerships

Alpha School's rapid 2025-2026 expansion was enabled through strategic partnerships and acquisitions rather than organic campus-by-campus development:

**Guidepost Montessori Partnership (July 2025)**: Strategic partnership accelerating expansion by opening K-3 elementary micro-schools in 9 new locations, dramatically increasing Alpha's reach while reducing the typical 1-2 year new school opening timeline. The partnership targeted 10 new K-8 campuses by December 2025. Locations from partnership include Charlotte NC, Raleigh NC, Folsom CA, Palm Beach FL, Chantilly VA, Lake Forest CA, Austin TX, and Plano TX. The partnership enables Alpha to leverage existing Guidepost facilities and communities for faster market entry.

**Higher Ground Education Asset Acquisition (July 2025)**: Alpha agreed to acquire key assets from Higher Ground Education (former parent company of Guidepost Montessori) including proprietary elementary educational materials and rights to select high-value campuses from closed Guidepost schools. The acquisition accelerates Alpha's growth timeline by approximately 2 years. The first campus from this acquisition was the San Francisco Marina location, which opened in August 2025.

**Media Contact**: Anna Davlantes, Director of Communications (anna@alpha.school, 312-488-3472) for press inquiries.

**Growth Impact**: The dual July 2025 announcements transformed Alpha from slower organic growth to rapid multi-state expansion, adding 8+ campuses in the 6-month period from August 2025 to January 2026. The strategy leverages distressed Guidepost assets during Higher Ground Education difficulties, positioning Alpha as a consolidator in the premium private education space.

### Expansion Plans and Future Locations

Alpha School has announced aggressive expansion targets for 2026 and beyond:

**Confirmed Fall 2026 Openings**:
- The Woodlands, TX (&#36;40,000 tuition, Houston area)
- Dorado, Puerto Rico (&#36;50,000 tuition)
- Palo Alto, CA (tuition TBD, Bay Area expansion due to demand)
- Santa Monica, CA (tuition TBD)
- Chicago, IL (tuition TBD)

**Additional Exploration Targets**: Aspen CO, Houston TX (additional to The Woodlands), Orlando FL, Phoenix AZ, East Bay CA (in addition to Palo Alto, suggesting dual Bay Area expansion).

**Bay Area Context**: ABC7 San Francisco reported Alpha is "looking to expand" in Palo Alto and East Bay due to "growing demand" following the San Francisco opening in August 2025.

**Expansion Strategy**: Geographic diversification across high-income markets (Palo Alto, Santa Monica, Chicago, Aspen) and newer markets (Puerto Rico, Orlando, Phoenix). Tuition positioning likely follows local market strategy: premium markets command &#36;50,000-&#36;75,000 (San Francisco model), mid-tier markets &#36;40,000-&#36;45,000 (Austin/Charlotte model), and strategic low-cost entries &#36;10,000-&#36;15,000 (Brownsville/Texas Sports Academy model).

**Timeline Variability**: "Exploring" targets (Aspen, Houston, Orlando, Phoenix, East Bay) lack confirmed opening dates or tuition—likely in planning/site selection phase vs. confirmed Fall 2026 openings.

**Campus Count Trajectory**: 17 operating campuses (January 2026) → 22+ campuses (Fall 2026) → unknown 2027 targets. The growth rate suggests doubling the network size annually through the partnership model.

**Community-Driven Expansion**: The website mentions "Bring Alpha To Your City" suggesting interest-driven expansion beyond announced targets.

**INFORMATION GAPS**: Specific opening dates within "Fall 2026" timeframe, exact addresses for announced campuses, leadership/staffing plans for new locations, enrollment capacity targets, and facility specifications are not publicly available.

## Examples

**Example 1: Austin Flagship Campus Experience**

A family lives in South Austin near the Barton Springs area and explores Alpha School for their 3rd grade child. They visit the Austin flagship campus at 1201 Spyglass Drive—a 10 minute drive from their home via MoPac. The campus, located in the Barton Hills neighborhood near Zilker Park, provides a familiar Austin environment. The family observes 150+ students engaged in a two-hour morning AI learning block with guides circulating to provide support. Campus features include outdoor play areas where students spend a minimum of 1 hour 15 minutes daily. The family learns the campus was established in 2016 (Year 11 of operation) and holds Cognia accreditation. Tuition is quoted at &#36;40,000/year for the 2024-2025 academic year—all-inclusive covering field trips, supplies, and enrichment with no additional fundraising requests. Hours align with the family's work schedule: drop-off 8:15-8:30 AM, pick-up 3:30-4:00 PM. The family contacts admissions at (512) 595-0801 or admissions.austin@alpha.school to schedule a Shadow Day.

INFORMATION STATUS: Austin flagship details documented from alpha.school/austin page and research sources; 150+ enrollment confirmed in public materials; Cognia accreditation verified; tuition from published materials; campus count (3 Austin locations: PreK-5, 6-8, 9-12) indicates vertical progression pathway within Austin market enabling students to remain in Alpha network through high school graduation.

**Example 2: Geographic Expansion Comparison - Brownsville vs. San Francisco**

Alpha School operates campuses in Brownsville TX and San Francisco CA, illustrating extreme tuition variance and market positioning strategy. **Brownsville Campus**: 591 N. Central Ave, Brownsville, TX 78521, serves PreK-8 students at &#36;10,000/year tuition (lowest in network); located near SpaceX headquarters in a border region with lower cost of living; &#36;10,000 tuition positions Alpha competitively against local private schools while remaining accessible to families with ESA vouchers or financial aid; the campus demonstrates Alpha's willingness to serve lower-income markets with adjusted pricing. **San Francisco Campus**: 3741 Buchanan St, San Francisco, CA 94123 (Marina/Fort Mason area), serves K-10 students at &#36;75,000/year tuition (highest in network); opened August 2025 as the 14th Alpha campus in a former Guidepost Montessori Fort Mason facility acquired through the Higher Ground Education asset deal; SF Standard described it as the "most expensive private school in the city," exceeding elite institutions like Convent & Stuart Hall (~&#36;50,000/year); &#36;75,000 tuition reflects San Francisco premium market positioning and high operational costs. Both campuses follow an identical operational model (8:15 AM - 4:00 PM, two-hour AI learning, 60-90 minutes outdoor play, life skills workshops, guides vs. teachers, no homework) despite the &#36;65,000 tuition difference. The tuition variance reflects local market conditions and family willingness-to-pay rather than a differentiated educational product.

INFORMATION STATUS: Tuition figures from research sources; Brownsville near SpaceX detail from research/locations.md; San Francisco opening date and facility history from PR Newswire and news sources; SF Standard comparison to Convent & Stuart Hall documented; identical operational model across network confirmed in standard features documentation.

**Example 3: Texas Sports Academy Multi-Location Model**

A family in the Houston area has a 6th grade child excelling in competitive baseball and seeking an academic program compatible with intensive training schedules. The family explores The Bennett School (Texas Sports Academy baseball campus) at 2626 W. Sam Houston Parkway N., Houston, TX 77043, serving grades 7-10. The school combines Alpha's two-hour AI-powered learning block with afternoon baseball-specific training, enabling student-athletes to accelerate academics while dedicating significant time to sport development. Tuition is quoted at &#36;15,000/year—significantly lower than standard Alpha campuses (&#36;40,000-&#36;75,000), reflecting the targeted market and specialized focus. The family learns that the Texas ESA program may provide approximately &#36;10,300 per student, reducing family cost to ~&#36;4,700/year. Since their child is currently in 6th grade, the family plans enrollment for the following year when entering 7th grade (minimum grade for The Bennett School). The family also considers the newly opened January 2026 baseball campus in Pearland, TX (18500 Pearland Sites Road, grades 4-8), which offers an earlier entry point. The model enables the child to complete core academics in the morning two-hour block (reading, math, language, science, social studies via AI platform with mastery-based progression) then transition to baseball training, strength/conditioning, and game strategy in the afternoon hours. If the child later decides to pursue a different path or reduce sport intensity, they can transfer to a standard Alpha campus (Houston area has multiple Alpha/specialty locations). The Texas Sports Academy network includes basketball (Round Rock, Houston locations), gymnastics (San Antonio), and cheer (Lago Vista Fall 2026), providing sport-specific pathways across Texas markets.

INFORMATION STATUS: The Bennett School details from research/locations.md citing Community Impact article; &#36;15,000 tuition and grade levels documented; Texas ESA ~&#36;10,300 figure from research sources; January 2026 Pearland opening from research; two-hour learning block + sport training model inferred from Alpha's standard academic structure applied to specialty school context; transfer flexibility between Alpha campuses represents logical operational capability though not explicitly documented in public materials.

**Q: Can my family choose any Alpha School location or do we have to attend the closest campus?**

A: Families can apply to any Alpha School campus regardless of proximity, as there are no publicly disclosed geographic enrollment restrictions. However, practical considerations apply: (1) Campus hours are 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM with drop-off 8:15-8:30 AM and pick-up 3:30-4:00 PM, requiring families to handle daily transportation; (2) Tuition varies significantly by location (&#36;10,000-&#36;75,000/year), so families may prefer campuses with pricing matching their budget even if farther away; (3) Some campuses explicitly note service areas (Fort Worth serves "Aledo, Tanglewood, Ridglea, Arlington, Keller, Southlake, Colleyville," suggesting broader geographic draw); (4) Transportation options like busing or carpool coordination are not detailed in public materials except for Fort Worth carpool mention, suggesting families are primarily responsible for daily transport; (5) Rolling admissions and the 5:1 student-guide ratio mean capacity limits may affect availability at the desired campus.
