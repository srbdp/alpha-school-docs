# Human Instruction

> At Alpha School, "guides" provide zero academic instruction, focusing entirely on motivation, mentorship, and emotional support while AI platforms handle all teaching.

## Overview

Alpha School uses the term "guides" rather than "teachers" to reflect a fundamental transformation in the educator role. Guides provide zero academic instruction—AI platforms handle all teaching. Instead, guides focus entirely on motivation, mentorship, and emotional support, helping students develop individual connections and identify their passions.

During the two-hour morning academic block, guides monitor student progress through AI dashboards, encouraging and motivating students while using AI monitoring data to identify when interventions are needed. Each student receives 30 minutes of weekly one-on-one time with guides to discuss progress, explore interests, and build deep relationships. Guides also facilitate afternoon life skills workshops, maintaining their mentorship focus beyond academics.

Guides earn a minimum of &#36;100,000 annually—described by Alpha as roughly double the average teacher pay in comparable markets. This compensation model enables recruitment of talented professionals outside traditional education, attracting individuals focused on mentorship and emotional support rather than academic instruction. The guide role embodies Alpha's "high standards, high support" philosophy: holding students accountable to mastery while offering encouragement through the learning process.

### Role Transformation from Traditional Teacher

The shift from "teachers" to "guides" represents a fundamental transformation in the educator role at Alpha School. Guides provide zero academic instruction—AI platforms handle all teaching, lesson delivery, and content explanation. This frees guides from traditional pedagogical responsibilities, allowing them to focus entirely on emotional support, motivation, and relationship-building.

Unlike traditional teachers who manage classrooms and deliver instruction to groups, guides connect with students individually. The role emphasizes understanding each student's unique motivations, identifying their passions and strengths, and helping them navigate the emotional challenges of learning. Where traditional teachers balance classroom management with instruction, guides focus on deep relationships and personalized mentorship.

This transformation reflects Alpha's belief that AI can handle academic instruction more effectively through personalized, adaptive learning, while human connection remains essential for motivation, emotional support, and helping students see the purpose in their learning journey.

### Core Responsibilities

Guides have six primary responsibilities during the school day:

1. **Monitor Student Progress**: During the two-hour morning AI learning block, guides circulate and monitor student engagement through AI dashboards showing real-time progress data.

2. **Encourage and Motivate**: Guides offer emotional support and encouragement when students face challenging concepts, helping them maintain persistence without providing academic instruction.

3. **Identify Passions and Strengths**: Through observation and conversation, guides help each student discover their unique interests and talents, connecting current learning to future possibilities.

4. **Hold High Standards with High Support**: Guides enforce mastery requirements and accountability while offering emotional encouragement, embodying Alpha's "high standards, high support" philosophy.

5. **Facilitate Life Skills Workshops**: In afternoon sessions, guides lead workshops focused on developing skills beyond academics, maintaining their mentorship role throughout the day.

6. **Use AI Data for Interventions**: Guides analyze AI monitoring data to identify students who are struggling, disengaged, or attempting to circumvent learning, intervening with supportive conversations rather than academic instruction.

### Student Relationships and Individualization

Each student receives 30 minutes of weekly one-on-one time with guides. These individual sessions focus on discussing progress, exploring emerging interests, and building deep relationships centered on understanding each student's motivations and goals.

Guides connect with students individually rather than managing large groups, enabling personalized relationships that traditional classroom ratios make difficult. This individualization allows guides to understand what drives each student, what challenges they face, and how to support them through difficult learning moments.

The guide-student relationship embodies Alpha's "high standards, high support" philosophy. Guides hold students accountable to mastery standards (90%+ proficiency requirements) while offering emotional encouragement and helping students understand that struggle leads to growth. This balance of accountability and support creates a foundation for both academic achievement and personal development.

### Compensation and Recruitment Model

According to Alpha School, guides earn a minimum of &#36;100,000 annually—described as roughly double the average teacher pay in comparable markets. This compensation model serves a strategic purpose: enabling recruitment of talented professionals outside traditional education.

By offering compensation significantly above typical teacher salaries, Alpha attracts individuals who may not have teaching credentials but possess strong mentorship abilities, emotional intelligence, and relationship-building skills. The role appeals to professionals focused on supporting and motivating young people rather than delivering academic instruction.

This recruitment strategy aligns with Alpha's educational model, where academic instruction is handled by AI platforms and the human role centers on motivation, mentorship, and emotional support. The higher compensation reflects both the different skill set required and the value Alpha places on the guide-student relationship.

### Integration with AI Platforms

Guides use AI monitoring data to support students effectively. AI platforms like Timeback and Incept track student progress in real-time, creating dashboards that show engagement levels, mastery status, and learning patterns. Guides monitor these dashboards during the two-hour morning academic block to identify students who may need encouragement or intervention.

Vision model analysis informs coaching interventions. AI systems analyze student behavior patterns—such as time spent on tasks, attempts to skip content, or signs of disengagement—and surface these insights to guides. When the data indicates a student is struggling or attempting to circumvent learning, guides approach the student for a supportive conversation.

Critically, guides do not override AI instruction. When a student struggles with a concept, guides offer emotional support and encouragement but do not teach the material. The AI platform handles instruction, adjusting difficulty and approach based on the student's responses. Guides ensure students stay engaged and help them work through challenges, maintaining focus on motivation and emotional support rather than academic content delivery.

## Examples

### Morning Monitoring Example

**Context**: During the two-hour AI learning block, a guide circulates the learning space monitoring student progress through an AI dashboard.

**Action**: The dashboard shows a student has attempted the same math concept three times without achieving mastery. The guide approaches the student, not to teach the concept, but to offer encouragement: "I see you're working through a tough challenge. That's exactly where learning happens. Keep going—the AI will adjust to help you understand it."

**Outcome**: The student feels supported and understood, gaining motivation to persist. The AI continues handling instruction, adjusting its approach based on the student's responses, while the guide has provided the emotional support needed to maintain engagement.

### Weekly One-on-One Meeting

**Context**: A guide meets with a student for their scheduled 30-minute weekly one-on-one session.

**Action**: The guide reviews the student's progress across subjects, noticing strong performance in biology and growing engagement with marine ecosystem topics. The guide shares genuine excitement: "I've noticed you light up when we talk about oceans. Have you thought about marine biology as something you might explore? Your current learning in biology is building the foundation for that."

**Outcome**: The student sees a connection between current academic work and a potential future passion. The guide helps the student understand the purpose behind their learning, strengthening motivation and creating a vision for how education connects to their interests.

### High Standards, High Support in Action

**Context**: AI monitoring data shows a student has been attempting to skip ahead through content without achieving mastery, a behavior pattern the system flags as "topic-shopping."

**Action**: The guide initiates a supportive conversation, sitting with the student: "The AI is showing me you've been moving through topics pretty quickly. I know it can feel frustrating to slow down, but mastery means really understanding something before moving on. I'm here to support you through the hard parts—that's where real growth happens."

**Outcome**: The student understands the guide is holding them accountable to mastery standards while offering emotional support. The conversation reinforces that struggle is part of learning, and the guide is there to help them through challenges without lowering expectations.
