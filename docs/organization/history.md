# History

> Alpha School's evolution from a microschool founded in 2014 for 16 kids in a house to a national AI-powered education network serving 17+ campuses across 8 states.

## Overview

Alpha School was founded in 2014 by MacKenzie Price as "Emergent Academy" after her daughters expressed that school was boring. Frustrated when told that changing the education system was "like trying to steer the Titanic," Price partnered with Brian Holtz, an Acton Academy parent, and started a school in Holtz's house with 16 kids. The early model branched from Acton Academy's microschool approach, using adaptive learning apps (Khan Academy, ALEKS, Math Academy) for personalized morning academics paired with afternoon activities like "neighborhood lemonade stand wars."

The school's trajectory changed dramatically in 2022 when Joe Liemandt invested approximately &#36;1 billion following the emergence of generative AI. This investment funded development of proprietary AI platforms including Timeback (personalized learning), Incept (custom LLM for curriculum generation), and vision monitoring technology. The first formal campus opened in 2016, and by 2025 Alpha School operated 17+ campuses across 8 states with widely varying tuition (&#36;10,000 in Brownsville, TX to &#36;75,000 in San Francisco, CA).

In 2025, Alpha School graduated its first senior class (11 of 12 students attended four-year universities) and expanded aggressively with new campuses while pursuing public charter school partnerships. Charter applications to Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Arkansas, and North Carolina were all rejected, with Pennsylvania's Department of Education citing the AI model as "untested." Only Arizona approved a partnership. Despite regulatory challenges, Alpha continues expanding with announced Fall 2026 openings in The Woodlands TX, Dorado PR, Palo Alto CA, Santa Monica CA, and Chicago IL.

## Details

### Founding (2014)

MacKenzie Price founded Alpha School (originally "Emergent Academy") in 2014 after her daughters, then in 3rd and 1st grade, expressed that school was boring. When told that changing the existing education system was "like trying to steer the Titanic," Price decided to start her own school rather than wait for systemic reform.

Price partnered with Brian Holtz, a parent at Acton Academy, a franchise of microschools. The school started in Holtz's house with 16 kids, including Price's two daughters. This founding group represented Alpha School's first cohort and established the intimate, personalized approach that would characterize the school's early years.

The decision to branch from Acton Academy reflected Price's desire for greater control over educational methodology and her willingness to experiment with technology-driven approaches that were emerging at the time.

### Early Model (2014-2016)

As a branch of Acton Academy, Alpha School's early model emphasized student agency and personalized learning. The school used off-the-shelf adaptive learning apps including Khan Academy, ALEKS, Math Academy, Newsela, and DreamBox to enable self-paced academic progress. Students worked through these platforms during morning academic blocks, with the software adapting to individual skill levels.

Afternoons were dedicated to hands-on activities designed to build real-world skills and entrepreneurial thinking. Notable activities included "neighborhood lemonade stand wars" (entrepreneurship and competition) and "Hero's Journey performances" (storytelling and public speaking). This balance of technology-driven academics and experiential learning established a pattern that would evolve into Alpha's later "2 Hour Learning" model.

The first formal campus opened in 2016, transitioning the school from a house-based microschool to an established educational institution with dedicated facilities.

### AI Investment & Platform Development (2022)

Following the emergence of generative AI in late 2021 and 2022, Joe Liemandt invested approximately &#36;1 billion to develop proprietary AI-powered learning platforms for Alpha School. This investment represented a fundamental shift from using off-the-shelf adaptive learning tools to building custom AI systems specifically designed for Alpha's educational philosophy.

Key platforms developed during this period include:

**Timeback**: An AI-powered personalized learning platform that adapts curriculum to individual student needs and tracks progress. Timeback serves as the core academic delivery system, replacing the collection of third-party adaptive apps used in the early model.

**Incept**: A custom large language model (LLM) designed for curriculum generation. Incept enables Alpha School to create and adapt educational content programmatically, supporting the school's mastery-based approach.

**Vision Monitoring**: Computer vision technology that tracks student engagement and identifies "anti-patterns" (behaviors indicating disengagement or difficulty). This system provides real-time feedback to guides and helps optimize learning conditions.

The platforms integrate with existing tools from Khan Academy, Trilogy Software, and Alpha's own engineering team, creating a comprehensive AI-powered learning environment. This technological infrastructure distinguishes modern Alpha School from its microschool origins and represents the school's evolution into an AI-first educational model.

### Charter School Initiatives (2025)

In 2025, Alpha School (through its related 2 Hour Learning initiative) applied to open public-school charter networks in multiple states, seeking to expand its AI-powered model beyond private schools into publicly funded education.

**Rejected Applications:**

Five states rejected Alpha's charter applications:
- **Pennsylvania**: Department of Education denied application, stating "The artificial intelligence instructional model being proposed by this school is untested and fails to demonstrate how the tools, methods and providers would ensure alignment to Pennsylvania academic standards."
- **Texas**: Application rejected
- **Utah**: Application rejected
- **Arkansas**: Application rejected
- **North Carolina**: Application rejected

Pennsylvania's rejection reasoning highlights a central tension in Alpha's expansion: regulatory bodies' concerns about unproven educational technology versus Alpha's claims of superior outcomes through AI-driven personalization.

**Approved Partnership:**

- **Arizona**: Approved partnership with Alpha School

**Media Coverage:**

The New York Times (July 2025) framed Alpha as a national model for AI in education while reporting on the charter rejections, highlighting the tension between educational innovation and regulatory approval processes. Coverage emphasized both Alpha's technological ambitions and the skepticism from state education departments about deploying AI systems without established track records in public education settings.

### Geographic Expansion (2025)

Alpha School's 2025 expansion strategy demonstrates geographic and economic diversity, serving vastly different markets with the same AI-powered educational model:

**Diverse Tuition Range:**
- **Brownsville, TX**: &#36;10,000/year (lowest tuition, serving South Texas border community)
- **Austin, TX**: &#36;40,000/year (flagship campus)
- **San Francisco, CA**: &#36;75,000/year (highest tuition, most expensive private school in San Francisco)

This tuition range (&#36;10,000 to &#36;75,000) reflects Alpha's stated goal of eventually reaching a billion kids with a &#36;1,000 tablet within 20 years. The simultaneous operation of high-cost urban campuses and lower-cost regional campuses suggests a strategy of using revenue from affluent markets to subsidize expansion into more accessible markets.

**New Campus Launches (2025):**
Alpha Raleigh NC (K-3), Alpha Anywhere Center NYC (K-8), Santa Barbara CA, Chantilly VA, Charlotte NC, plus campuses across AZ, FL, and additional TX locations.

**Announced Fall 2026 Openings:**
The Woodlands TX, Dorado PR, Palo Alto CA, Santa Monica CA, Chicago IL. These additions represent continued multi-state expansion with entry into new markets (Puerto Rico, Chicago metro).

The expansion pattern suggests Alpha is testing its model across diverse demographics, geographies, and price points while building toward the long-term vision of mass-market educational technology accessible to families across economic strata.

## Examples

### Example 1: Origin Story - From Frustration to Founding

**Catalyst**: MacKenzie Price's daughters (3rd and 1st grade) expressed that "school was boring," sparking Price's interest in alternative education approaches.

**Frustration**: When Price explored changing the existing education system, she was told it was "like trying to steer the Titanic" — implying that systemic reform was too difficult and slow to help her children.

**Action**: Rather than accept this limitation, Price founded "Emergent Academy" in 2014, partnering with Brian Holtz (an Acton Academy parent) to start a school in Holtz's house with 16 kids.

**Model**: The early school used adaptive apps (Khan Academy, ALEKS, Math Academy, Newsela, DreamBox) for personalized morning academics, with afternoons dedicated to activities like "neighborhood lemonade stand wars" (teaching entrepreneurship and competition) and "Hero's Journey performances" (building storytelling and public speaking skills).

**Outcome**: This house-based experiment became the foundation for what would evolve into a multi-state school network with proprietary AI platforms.

### Example 2: Evolution from Microschool to AI Platform

**2014 Starting Point**: 16 kids in Brian Holtz's house using off-the-shelf adaptive learning apps (Khan Academy, ALEKS, DreamBox) for self-paced academics.

**2016 Progression**: First formal campus opened, establishing Alpha as an independent school rather than a house-based microschool.

**2022 Turning Point**: Joe Liemandt invested approximately &#36;1 billion following the emergence of generative AI, funding development of proprietary platforms.

**2022-2025 Development**: Custom AI infrastructure built including Timeback (personalized learning platform), Incept (curriculum generation LLM), and vision monitoring (engagement tracking). Integration with Khan Academy, Trilogy Software, and in-house engineering.

**2025 Current State**: 17+ campuses across 8 states, proprietary AI platform replacing off-the-shelf tools, first graduating senior class (11 of 12 students to four-year universities), campus sizes of 155+ students, tuition ranging from &#36;10,000 to &#36;75,000 depending on location.

**Transformation**: From a microschool testing adaptive software to an AI-first education company with billion-dollar platform investment and national expansion ambitions.

### Example 3: Expansion Strategy - Geographic and Economic Diversity

**Low-Cost Market**: Brownsville, TX campus charges &#36;10,000/year tuition, targeting South Texas border community and demonstrating Alpha's model can operate at lower price points.

**High-Cost Market**: San Francisco, CA campus charges &#36;75,000/year, the most expensive private school in San Francisco, serving affluent families willing to pay premium pricing for AI-powered education.

**Flagship Campus**: Austin, TX at &#36;40,000/year serves as the original home base with mid-tier pricing.

**Geographic Diversity**: Simultaneous expansion across 8 states (AZ, CA, FL, NC, NY, TX, VA) plus announced Puerto Rico campus, testing model across diverse demographics, regulatory environments, and economic conditions.

**Strategic Rationale**: This multi-tiered pricing and geographic strategy appears designed to validate the educational model across market segments while building toward Alpha's long-term vision of a &#36;1,000 tablet reaching a billion kids within 20 years. High-cost campuses may subsidize development and expansion into more accessible markets.

**Regulatory Navigation**: Charter applications submitted to 6 states (5 rejected, 1 approved), suggesting Alpha is pursuing both private school expansion and public charter partnerships to accelerate growth and demonstrate model viability in regulated public education settings.
