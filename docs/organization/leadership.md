# Leadership

> Alpha School's founder-led governance structure, led by two key people: Joe Liemandt (Principal/Founder) and MacKenzie Price (Co-Founder).

## Overview

Alpha School operates under a founder-led governance model with two confirmed leaders at its helm. Joe Liemandt serves as Principal and Founder, bringing decades of technology entrepreneurship experience from founding Trilogy Software and ESW Capital. MacKenzie Price co-founded the school in 2014 (initially as "Emergent Academy") after her daughters expressed that school was boring.

The leadership team combines expertise in technology entrepreneurship and education innovation. Joe Liemandt's background in artificial intelligence—having created what was described as "the world's first billion-dollar artificial intelligence product" (SalesBuilder at Trilogy)—directly informs Alpha School's AI-powered learning model. MacKenzie Price's Stanford psychology background and personal motivation as a parent drive the school's focus on student engagement and personalized learning.

Alpha School's leadership structure is closely affiliated with Trilogy Software and ESW Capital, with both leaders having deep ties to this technology ecosystem. Joe Liemandt founded both Trilogy (1989) and ESW Capital (2001). This affiliation enables Alpha School to leverage technological resources and expertise from the broader ecosystem, including Joe Liemandt's approximately &#36;1 billion investment since 2022 to develop AI software products like the Timeback personalized learning platform.

## Details

### Joe Liemandt - Principal/Founder

Joe Liemandt is a software entrepreneur who dropped out of Stanford University in 1989 to co-found Trilogy Software with programmer John Lynch. At Stanford, he majored in economics with computer science courses and studied under Ed Feigenbaum, known as the "father of expert systems."

Trilogy Software developed SalesBuilder, described as "the world's first billion-dollar artificial intelligence product." Liemandt's success was rapid—he made the Forbes 400 list at age 27 and achieved a net worth exceeding &#36;600 million by 1998. In 2001, he founded ESW Capital, expanding his technology portfolio beyond Trilogy.

According to the Colossus profile, Liemandt initially resisted getting involved with Alpha School but became deeply engaged after observing that his daughters preferred school to vacation. Since 2022, following the emergence of generative AI technologies, he has invested approximately &#36;1 billion to fund and incubate AI software products at Alpha School, including the Timeback personalized learning platform. He currently serves as principal, describing his role as "product guy" and "dean of parents."

### MacKenzie Price - Co-Founder

MacKenzie Price is a Stanford University graduate with a bachelor's degree in psychology. Before founding Alpha School, she worked for a mortgage lender company and retired from that career in 2018.

Her founding motivation was personal and direct: her daughters expressed that "school was boring," which catalyzed her vision to revolutionize K-12 education. In 2014, she founded what was initially called "Emergent Academy," starting with 16 children (including her daughters) in a house owned by Brian Holtz, a parent at Acton Academy.

Today, MacKenzie Price hosts the "Future of Education" podcast and YouTube channel, where she discusses educational innovation and Alpha School's model. She is a member of the Forbes Technology Council and continues to be based in Austin, Texas, where the organization's headquarters is located.

### Governance Structure

Alpha School operates as a founder-led private school with decision-making concentrated among its key leaders. The organization's governance structure is closely tied to its affiliated organizations—Trilogy Software, ESW Capital, and the broader 2 Hour Learning initiative—though the specific nature of formal governance relationships is not publicly documented.

Joe Liemandt's substantial financial investment (approximately &#36;1 billion since 2022) and role as principal suggests significant operational authority. MacKenzie Price's role as original founder and ongoing public presence through her podcast indicates continued strategic influence.

The lack of publicly available information about board composition, formal organizational charts, or complete team rosters beyond these leaders limits what can be authoritatively stated about the governance structure.
