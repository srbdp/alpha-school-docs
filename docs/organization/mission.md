# Mission, Vision, Values

> Alpha School's driving purpose is to unlock children's limitless potential through revolutionary AI-powered education that compresses academics into two hours and gives students their childhoods back.

## Overview

Alpha School's foundational philosophy challenges the constraints of traditional education. The organization believes children are "limitless" and can achieve far more than conventional schooling allows when given personalized, mastery-based instruction powered by AI. Founder Joe Liemandt frames education as "a trillion-dollar market with no good products" and seeks to fundamentally reimagine what school can be.

The mission centers on unlocking children's potential through a revolutionary educational model built on 40 years of learning science. This includes concepts like the zone of proximal development and cognitive load theory, prioritizing a shift from time-based systems to mastery-based systems where students must demonstrate 90%+ proficiency before advancing. The approach aims to give children "their childhoods back" by compressing academic instruction into two hours daily while maintaining top-percentile performance.

Alpha School's long-term vision is to democratize this model globally through a sub-\$1,000 tablet that "teaches everything in two hours," reaching a billion kids within 20 years. Currently operating at \$10,000-\$75,000 annual tuition across 17+ campuses, the organization positions AI as "the light microscope for education"—finally enabling individualized instruction at scale that pedagogical research has long advocated but traditional systems couldn't deliver.

### Mission

Alpha School's mission is to unlock children's potential through a revolutionary educational model that challenges traditional schooling constraints. The core belief is that children are "limitless" and can achieve far more when given personalized, mastery-based instruction.

Founder Joe Liemandt describes education as "a trillion-dollar market with no good products" and positions Alpha School as solving this through AI-powered individualized learning. The mission emphasizes giving children "their childhoods back" by compressing academic instruction into two hours daily while maintaining mastery-level performance, freeing time for life skills development, passion projects, and play.

The approach is built on "40 years of proven learning science" including the zone of proximal development and cognitive load theory, prioritizing a fundamental shift from time-based systems (where seat time determines advancement) to mastery-based systems (where students must demonstrate 90%+ proficiency before progressing).

**Note**: Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission described here is inferred from organizational messaging across the alpha.school website and founder interviews.

### Vision

Alpha School's stated long-term vision is to make AI-powered personalized education accessible globally through:
- **Product Goal**: "A sub-\$1,000 tablet that teaches everything in two hours"
- **Reach Goal**: Reaching "a billion kids" within 20 years
- **Democratization**: Making education currently costing \$10,000-\$75,000 annually accessible at sub-\$1,000 price point

Joe Liemandt frames AI as "the light microscope for education"—a transformative tool that finally enables the individualized instruction pedagogical research has long advocated. The vision positions AI not as replacement for teachers but as technology enabling educational approaches that were previously impossible at scale.

### Values

**Note**: Alpha School does not publish an explicit "Our Values" page on its website. The values listed below are inferred from organizational messaging, operational decisions, and stated commitments.

**Implicit Values:**

- **High Standards, High Support** - Young people thrive when held to elevated expectations within highly supportive environments. This manifests in 90%+ mastery requirements combined with 5:1 student-to-guide ratios and \$100,000+ guide salaries.

- **Mastery Over Time** - Focus on demonstrated proficiency (90%+ on assessments) rather than traditional time-based progression. Students advance when ready, not when the calendar dictates.

- **Holistic Development** - Commitment to developing the whole child through academics (2 hours) plus extensive life skills training (4 hours) including entrepreneurship, leadership, financial literacy, public speaking, and teamwork.

- **Teacher/Guide Investment** - Commitment to paying guides minimum \$100,000 salaries (roughly double the ~\$50,000 national average teacher salary), positioning them as highly-paid mentors rather than traditional instructors.

### Three Core Commitments

Alpha School makes three explicit promises to parents, prominently featured on its website:

1. **Love School** - "Your child will love school more than vacation." Students develop genuine enthusiasm for learning through personalized pacing, AI-powered engagement, and focus on mastery rather than frustration.

2. **Learn 2x in 2hrs** - Academic mastery with top 1% performance in only two hours daily. Alpha School claims students learn 2.6x faster than national norms (self-reported, unverified by independent third parties).

3. **Learn Life Skills** - Students develop critical life skills through high standards and high support. Afternoon workshops (4 hours) emphasize entrepreneurship, leadership, financial literacy, public speaking, and teamwork—capabilities often absent from traditional curricula.

### Learning Science Foundation

Alpha School's claim of "40 years of proven learning science" references research in educational psychology and cognitive science:

**Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)**: Learning is most effective when students work at the edge of their current capability with appropriate support—precisely what AI-powered adaptive platforms can deliver at scale.

**Cognitive Load Theory**: Breaking learning into optimal chunks and sequences prevents cognitive overload. AI platforms can dynamically adjust difficulty and pacing to maintain optimal cognitive load for each student.

**Mastery Learning (Bloom's 2 Sigma)**: Benjamin Bloom's research showed one-on-one tutoring produces learning gains two standard deviations above classroom instruction. Alpha positions AI as enabling "2 Sigma" gains at scale by providing personalized tutoring-like instruction.

The shift from time-based to mastery-based systems means students must demonstrate 90%+ proficiency before advancing, ensuring solid foundations rather than knowledge gaps that compound over time.

## Examples

### Example 1: Daily Schedule Reflects Commitments

Alpha School's daily schedule directly fulfills the Three Core Commitments:

**Morning (2 hours)**: AI-powered academic instruction using "Time Back" and "Dash" platforms
- Fulfills **Learn 2x in 2hrs**: Compressed academics with mastery-based progression
- Contributes to **Love School**: Personalized pacing prevents frustration and boredom

**Afternoon (4 hours)**: Life skills workshops and passion projects
- Fulfills **Learn Life Skills**: Entrepreneurship, leadership, public speaking, financial literacy
- Contributes to **Love School**: Students pursue interests and develop real-world capabilities

The structure gives students "their childhoods back" by limiting academics to 2 hours while maintaining top-percentile performance.

### Example 2: Vision Milestone Progression

**Current State (2026)**: Alpha School operates 17+ campuses with tuition ranging from \$10,000 (Brownsville, TX) to \$75,000 (San Francisco, CA). Average tuition ~\$40,000.

**Vision Goal (2046)**: Sub-\$1,000 tablet accessible to a billion kids within 20 years.

This represents a democratization journey from premium private school pricing to globally-accessible technology platform. The vision requires technological advances, cost reductions, and market expansion Alpha School believes AI will enable.

### Example 3: Values in Action - Teacher Investment

**Value**: Teacher/Guide Investment

**Implementation**: Guides earn minimum \$100,000 salaries—roughly double the ~\$50,000 national average teacher salary.

**Philosophy**: High compensation attracts talent, enables 5:1 student-to-guide ratios, and positions guides as mentors/facilitators rather than traditional instructors. This reflects the "High Standards, High Support" value—investing heavily in human relationships while AI handles instruction.
