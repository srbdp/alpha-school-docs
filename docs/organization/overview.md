# Alpha School

> An AI-powered private K-12 school using the "2 Hour Learning" mastery-based model to compress academic instruction into two hours daily.

## Overview

Alpha School is a private K-12 educational institution operating across multiple U.S. states. The organization uses what it calls the "2 Hour Learning" model—an AI-powered, mastery-based approach where students complete academic instruction in approximately two hours daily through personalized, adaptive learning platforms. Once academic work is completed, students spend the remainder of the school day on life skills workshops, passion projects, and mentorship activities.

Founded in 2014 by MacKenzie Price and formally established in 2016, Alpha School has expanded to 17 campuses across 8 states as of 2026. The school requires students to demonstrate 90%+ mastery (vs. traditional 70% passing grades) before advancing to new material. Teachers, called "Guides," earn minimum salaries of &#36;100,000+ and focus on mentorship rather than direct instruction, as AI platforms handle the primary academic teaching.

Alpha School reports that its students achieve accelerated academic growth—averaging 2.6 times faster progress than national norms on MAP standardized tests—though these claims are self-reported and have not been independently verified. Tuition ranges from &#36;10,000 to &#36;75,000 annually depending on location, making it among the most expensive private schools in certain markets such as San Francisco.

## Details

### Educational Model

The "2 Hour Learning" model compresses academic instruction into approximately two hours of daily AI-powered, mastery-based learning. Students work individually with adaptive learning platforms including proprietary tools (Timeback, Dash, Incept) as well as third-party applications (IXL, Khan Academy). The system requires students to demonstrate 90%+ accuracy on assessments before advancing to new material, compared to traditional schools' 70% passing threshold.

Alpha School reports that this approach enables students to complete an entire grade level of academic content in 20-30 hours versus the traditional 200 hours, resulting in what the organization claims is 2.6x faster learning growth on average. Once academic work is complete, students engage in four hours of life skills workshops covering entrepreneurship, public speaking, financial literacy, leadership, and teamwork.

The model is based on educational research including Bloom's 2 Sigma problem, zone of proximal development, and cognitive load theory. According to Alpha School, the approach transforms education from a time-based system to a mastery-based system.

### Leadership

**Joe Liemandt** serves as Principal and is the primary investor, having contributed approximately &#36;1 billion to develop the AI-powered learning platforms since 2022. Liemandt is a software entrepreneur who co-founded Trilogy Software in 1989 after dropping out of Stanford University. He previously made the Forbes 400 list at age 27 and founded ESW Capital in 2001. His involvement with Alpha School deepened after his daughters attended and preferred school to vacation.

**MacKenzie Price** is co-founder of Alpha School, having started the institution in 2014 when her daughters expressed that "school was boring." Price holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford University and worked in the mortgage industry before retiring in 2018 to focus on education. She hosts the "Future of Education" podcast and serves as a Forbes Technology Council Member.

**Andrew Price**, MacKenzie's husband (married 2004), serves as co-founder and CFO. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Rice University and has served in financial leadership roles at Trilogy Software, ESW Capital, Ignite Technologies, and Crossover since 1996.

### History

Alpha School was founded in 2014 by MacKenzie Price and Brian Holtz, starting in Holtz's home with 16 children including Price's daughters. The school was originally called "Emergent Academy" and branched off from Acton Academy, a microschool franchise. The first formal campus opened in 2016.

In 2022, following the emergence of generative AI technologies, Joe Liemandt invested approximately &#36;1 billion to develop the Timeback platform and related AI-powered learning tools. The school has since expanded to 17 campuses across Arizona, California, Florida, North Carolina, New York, Texas, and Virginia.

In 2025, Alpha School's first graduating class saw 11 of 12 seniors attend four-year universities. That same year, the school opened its most expensive campus in San Francisco (&#36;75,000/year tuition) and launched multiple new locations including Raleigh, NYC, Santa Barbara, Chantilly VA, and Charlotte NC.

The organization has attempted to expand through charter school applications in Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Arkansas, and North Carolina, but these applications were rejected by state education boards. Only Arizona agreed to partner with Alpha School for charter school operations.

### Geographic Presence

As of 2026, Alpha School operates 17 campuses across 8 U.S. states:
- **Texas**: 6 locations (Austin PK-5, Austin 6-8, Austin High 9-12, Brownsville, Fort Worth, Plano)
- **California**: 3 locations (Lake Forest, San Francisco, Santa Barbara)
- **Florida**: 3 locations (Miami, Palm Beach, Tampa)
- **North Carolina**: 2 locations (Charlotte, Raleigh)
- **Arizona**: 1 location (Scottsdale)

Announced expansions for Fall 2026 include The Woodlands TX, Dorado PR, Palo Alto CA, Santa Monica CA, and Chicago IL. The organization also operates Texas Sports Academy (6 locations), Alpha Anywhere (online program), and 6 specialty schools under the Alpha umbrella.

### Affiliations

Alpha School has close organizational ties to **Trilogy Software**, a division of Trilogy Enterprises founded and led by Joe Liemandt. The "2 Hour Learning" platform is a collection of AI-driven applications owned by Trilogy Software. Andrew Price serves as CFO across multiple Trilogy-affiliated entities including Trilogy, ESW Capital, Ignite Technologies, and Crossover.

The organization also operates or licenses its educational model to related schools including GT School, Lake Travis Sports Academy, NextGen Academy, Novatio School, and the proposed Unbound Academy charter school network. Media sources have noted governance concerns regarding board members serving dual roles as both school governors and executives at vendor companies (Trilogy/ESW Capital).

### Example 1: Daily Student Schedule

A typical Alpha School day runs from 8:30am to 3:00-4:00pm:
