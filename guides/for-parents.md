# Parent's Guide

Welcome to this comprehensive guide about Alpha School. If you're researching educational options for your child, you're likely weighing a significant decision. This guide synthesizes everything publicly known about Alpha School to help you understand what makes this school different, what it offers, and whether it might be the right fit for your family.

## What Is Alpha School?

Alpha School (formally Legacy of Education, Inc.) is a private school network founded in 2014 by MacKenzie Price, a Stanford psychology graduate and mother who started the school when her daughters said traditional school was boring. What began with 16 kids in a house has grown to 17 campuses across 8 states serving students from PreK through 12th grade.

The school is built on a bold premise: that children can master a full day's worth of academics in just two hours using AI-powered personalized learning, freeing up the rest of the day for hands-on life skills, entrepreneurship, outdoor play, and pursuing personal passions. Alpha claims students not only learn faster but actually love school more than vacation—with 95% of students reporting they love school and 60% saying they'd choose school over vacation.

This model is backed by substantial investment from Joe Liemandt, a tech entrepreneur who made the Forbes 400 by age 27 and has invested approximately \$1 billion to develop Alpha's AI platform after his own daughters preferred school to vacation.

## The Educational Model: What Makes Alpha Different

### The Two-Hour Learning Promise

Alpha's signature claim is that students can master traditional academics—math, English, science, and social studies—in approximately two hours each morning, compared to six hours in traditional schools. Here's how a typical day works:

**Morning (2 hours):** Students work independently on AI-powered lessons in core subjects, using 25-minute focused sessions (called Pomodoro blocks) alternating between subjects with breaks. The platform adapts to each student's level—a 4th grader might work at 5th grade math, 3rd grade reading, and 4th grade science simultaneously based on demonstrated mastery, not age.

**Afternoon (2.5-4 hours):** Students participate in hands-on life skills workshops—entrepreneurship, public speaking, financial literacy, teamwork, leadership, coding, and outdoor activities. These aren't token additions; they're structured progressions with real outcomes.

**The result:** Students complete academics by lunch with no homework, then spend afternoons on projects like running Airbnb operations, operating food trucks, training for 5K races, or traveling internationally (included in tuition).

### How AI Powers Learning

Alpha's "Time Back" platform functions as a personalized tutor, but it's important to understand what that means in practice. Despite marketing language about "AI tutoring," the platform doesn't use chatbots like ChatGPT (which Alpha explicitly says "enable cheating"). Instead, it combines third-party tools like IXL, Khan Academy, and Math Academy with proprietary apps to create custom lesson sequences.

The system:
- Applies proven learning science (spaced repetition, cognitive load theory, multimodal support)
- Requires 90% mastery before advancing (versus traditional 70% passing grades)
- Tracks each student's "knowledge graph" to identify gaps
- Provides immediate feedback and targeted practice
- Uses vision models to monitor engagement and inform when guides should intervene

An independent parent reviewer noted the platform contains "zero generative AI" and is "closer to a turbocharged spreadsheet with spaced-repetition algorithm"—effective, but not the cutting-edge AI tutor marketing suggests.

### The Role of Human Guides

Alpha doesn't have traditional teachers. Instead, "guides" provide zero academic instruction—their entire role is motivation, mentorship, and emotional support. Here's what that looks like:

- **Compensation:** \$100,000+ annually (roughly double average teacher pay)
- **Ratio:** 5:1 students per guide (versus 15-30:1 in most schools)
- **Responsibilities:** Monitor progress, encourage persistence, facilitate afternoon workshops, help students discover passions, maintain high standards while offering support
- **One-on-one time:** Each student receives 30 minutes weekly with their guide

This represents a fundamental shift: rather than adults delivering information, students learn from software while adults provide the human elements—encouragement, accountability, and care—that keep students motivated.

### What a Day Actually Looks Like

**8:15 AM:** Drop-off and "Limitless Launch" goal-setting session

**9:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** AI-powered academics (though some parents report this extends to 3-3.5 hours depending on the student)

**Lunch**

**Afternoon:** Life skills workshops appropriate to age:
- **PreK:** "Picnic Planners," "LEGO Master Builder"
- **K-1:** "Fair Play Academy," "Water for Life Project"
- **Grades 2-3:** "Escape Room Expert," "Alpha News Live"
- **Grades 4-5:** "Business Launch Pad," "FBI Fitness Challenge"
- **Grades 6-8:** "Pirates & Sailing Crew," "Startup Founder," "Spartan Race Finisher"
- **High School:** Self-directed four-year "super passion projects" with mentorship

**3:30-4:00 PM:** Pick-up

Students also get 60-90 minutes of outdoor play daily, weather permitting.

## What Students Learn

### Academic Curriculum

Alpha follows established standards:
- **K-8:** Common Core curriculum
- **High School:** Advanced Placement (AP) curriculum
- **Core Subjects:** Mathematics, English/Language Arts (reading, writing, grammar), Science, History/Social Studies (integrated into reading), Foreign Language

All learning is mastery-based with 90%+ accuracy required before advancing. Students are placed via MAP diagnostic tests during their Shadow Day, not by age. This means genuine personalization: a student two years behind can catch up through accelerated learning, while advanced students move ahead without waiting.

However, there are notable limitations. All testing is multiple-choice format, which means limited assessment of essay writing, creative thinking, or long-form analysis. An independent reviewer acknowledged Alpha's writing platform (AlphaWrite) as inadequate, and there are valid concerns about "teaching to the test."

### Life Skills: The Other Half of Education

Alpha explicitly teaches 24 life skills organized into five areas:
1. **Teamwork & Leadership**
2. **Storytelling & Public Speaking** (progression example: speaking to cats at animal shelters → open mic nights in NYC)
3. **Entrepreneurship & Financial Literacy**
4. **Relationship Building & Socialization**
5. **Grit & Hard Work**

These aren't abstract concepts. Real examples from Alpha campuses include:
- Fifth graders running profitable Airbnb operations
- Fifth/sixth graders operating food trucks generating \$4,000+ profit
- Second graders building businesses that raise \$5,000 for charity
- Students completing Spartan races, traveling to Poland, attending Formula 1 events (all included in tuition)

The emphasis on practical skills, outdoor challenges, and real-world projects distinguishes Alpha from both traditional schools and typical test-prep-focused alternative schools.

## Academic Outcomes: What the Evidence Shows

### Performance Claims

Alpha reports impressive academic results:
- Students grow "2.6 times faster than peers on nationally normed MAP tests" (average)
- Top performers achieve 6.5x growth compared to national norms
- Students "score in the top 1% nationally"
- K-2 students perform in "top 0.1% nationally"
- High school students average 1410 SAT as freshmen, median 1530/1600 for seniors
- 90% of students earn all 4s or 5s on AP exams

### College Outcomes (First Graduating Class)

Alpha's inaugural graduating class of 2025 had 12 students:
- 11 of 12 (92%) enrolled in four-year universities
- Acceptances included Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, Northeastern, Texas A&M, UT Austin
- 50% earned National Merit Scholar or Commended Scholar status
- Alpha claims these students are "maintaining 4.0 GPAs" in college (not independently verified)

### Evidence from Brownsville

Perhaps most interesting is Alpha's Brownsville, Texas campus, which charges just \$10,000 annually (versus \$40,000-\$75,000 elsewhere) and serves a different demographic. Results there suggest the model works beyond "rich-kid selection effects":
- One second-grade math class improved from 31st to 84th percentile in one year
- First cohort caught up to national average within nine months
- Achieved approximately 2x national average learning velocity

### Important Caveats You Need to Know

**No independent verification:** All major performance claims originate from Alpha School itself. There are no independent audits, peer-reviewed studies, or third-party validation of results.

**Small sample sizes:** The graduating class had only 12 students. Some cited cohorts completing MAP tests included just 5 students.

**Selection bias:** High tuition (\$40,000-\$75,000 at most campuses) pre-selects affluent families. Some sources suggest admission requires scoring in the "top tenth percentile" or "top 3% on IQ tests." Families who choose Alpha differ systematically from the general population, and as MacKenzie Price acknowledges, "willing-to-innovate parents may inherently support children's success beyond socioeconomic factors alone."

**Limited track record:** Only one graduating class exists. Long-term outcomes—college graduation rates, career success, life satisfaction—remain unknown.

**Regulatory skepticism:** Charter school applications have been rejected in Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Arkansas, and North Carolina. Pennsylvania's Department of Education stated: "The artificial intelligence instructional model being proposed by this school is untested and fails to demonstrate how the tools, methods and providers would ensure alignment to Pennsylvania academic standards."

**Measurement limitations:** MAP tests assess only multiple-choice knowledge. There's no standardized assessment of the creative writing, public speaking, or entrepreneurial skills Alpha emphasizes in the afternoons.

**Information not disclosed:** Alpha doesn't publish attrition rates, acceptance rates, demographic breakdowns, how dropouts affect reported outcomes, or guide training programs.

The honest assessment: Alpha's model shows genuine promise backed by compelling (though self-reported) evidence. The results aren't fabricated—real students are achieving accelerated growth. But claims about "2.6x faster learning" come from Alpha itself, and the model remains unproven by traditional educational research standards.

## Practical Information: Enrollment, Costs, and Locations

### How to Enroll

Alpha uses a three-step process:

1. **Attend a Showcase Event:** Explore the learning approach and campus environment
2. **Submit Application:** Complete application form + \$100 non-refundable fee per student
3. **Shadow Day:** Your child experiences a full day of AI academics and afternoon workshops while taking MAP diagnostic assessments

After Shadow Day, you'll meet with an admissions coordinator to review MAP results and set academic goals. If accepted, you'll complete enrollment forms, submit required documentation (immunizations, school records, waivers, emergency contacts, physical exam), and pay a \$1,000 enrollment deposit (applied toward tuition).

Alpha uses rolling admissions with no fixed deadlines, though capacity is limited by the 5:1 student-guide ratio.

### Tuition and Financial Considerations

Tuition varies significantly by location, ranging from \$10,000 to \$75,000 annually:

| Location | Annual Tuition |
|----------|---------------|
| San Francisco, CA | \$75,000 |
| New York City, NY | \$65,000 |
| Chantilly, VA (DC area) | \$65,000 |
| Plano, TX | \$50,000 |
| Miami, Santa Barbara, Lake Forest, Palm Beach, FL | \$50,000 |
| Charlotte, Raleigh, NC | \$45,000 |
| Austin, Fort Worth, Tampa, Scottsdale | \$40,000 |
| Texas Sports Academy | \$15,000 |
| Brownsville, TX | \$10,000 |

**What tuition covers:** Everything. All field trips (including international travel), all supplies, enrichment programs, afternoon workshops, sports, arts, technology, platform access, MAP assessments. Alpha's FAQ explicitly states they will "never EVER ask parents for additional fundraising."

**What's NOT included:** The documentation doesn't specify whether lunch, before/after-school care, transportation, or optional summer programs are included.

**Fees and deposits:**
- Application fee: \$100 per student (non-refundable)
- Enrollment deposit: \$1,000 per student (applied toward tuition)
- **Total first-year cost example** (Austin): \$100 + \$40,000 - \$1,000 = \$39,100

**Financial aid:** Alpha uses Clarity software to calculate tuition assistance based on family financial information (tax returns, income, assets, expenses). However, tuition assistance is NOT guaranteed, and Alpha doesn't disclose income thresholds, award ranges, approval rates, or average awards.

**School vouchers—the affordability strategy:** Alpha accepts state-funded school vouchers in eligible states (Texas, Florida, Arizona, others). Typical vouchers provide ~\$12,000/year. For a \$15,000 micro-school or Texas Sports Academy campus, a \$12,000 voucher reduces family cost to \$3,000 annually (~\$250-300/month)—an 80% reduction. Voucher eligibility varies by state.

**Sibling discount:** 5% reduction on tuition for second child and all subsequent children. This combines with vouchers.

**Combined example** (two children, Texas micro-school with vouchers):
- First child: \$15,000 - \$12,000 voucher = \$3,000
- Second child: \$14,250 (5% discount) - \$12,000 voucher = \$2,250
- **Total family cost:** \$5,250/year (~\$437/month)

All campuses operate 8:15 AM - 4:00 PM daily with the same 5:1 student-guide ratio, \$100k+ guide compensation, 2-hour academic model, and all-inclusive tuition approach.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will my child get enough socialization?**

A: Alpha students interact with peers throughout the day—during breaks, lunch, afternoon workshops (which are inherently collaborative), and outdoor play (60-90 minutes daily). The 5:1 student-guide ratio means more adult attention than typical schools. However, if you define socialization as large-group classroom interaction with 25+ peers simultaneously, Alpha provides less of that. Student testimonials suggest strong peer relationships form around shared projects rather than shared classes.

**Q: Will the AI platform prepare my child for college writing and critical thinking?**

A: This is a legitimate concern. Independent reviewers acknowledge Alpha's writing instruction (AlphaWrite) is inadequate, and 100% multiple-choice testing doesn't assess essay writing, argumentation, or long-form analysis. Alpha's first graduating class had strong college acceptances and SAT scores, suggesting students developed these skills, but how they developed them (afternoon workshops? at home? guide support?) isn't documented. If your child is a strong writer, this may matter less; if writing is a challenge, ask specifically how Alpha addresses this during your campus visit.

**Q: What if my child is significantly behind grade level?**

A: Alpha's mastery-based, personalized model is specifically designed for this. The AI platform meets students where they are—whether two years behind or three years ahead. Alpha claims a student two years behind can reach grade level in "40-60 hours of focused study" (approximately 2-3 months). The Brownsville campus results (students advancing from 31st to 84th percentile in one year) support this claim. During Shadow Day, MAP tests determine your child's starting point in each subject.

**Q: What about students with learning differences or special needs?**

A: Alpha's public documentation doesn't detail accommodations for students with IEPs, 504 plans, ADHD, dyslexia, or other learning differences. The self-paced, individualized model may benefit some students (less stigma, work at own pace, frequent breaks), but the lack of certified special education teachers and heavy technology reliance may challenge others. Ask specifically about support for your child's needs during campus visits.

**Q: Can my child participate in sports and extracurriculars?**

A: Alpha includes afternoon workshops, outdoor activities, and physical challenges (5K training, Spartan races, sports skills) in tuition. However, there's no documentation of competitive sports teams, band, drama productions, or traditional extracurriculars. Some families supplement with outside activities (club sports, music lessons, etc.). If your child is passionate about competitive athletics or performing arts, ask about options during your visit.

**Q: How do I know if Alpha is right for my child?**

A: Alpha recommends their online assessment tool at match.app.alpha.school as a first step. Based on available information, Alpha seems best suited for:
- Students who are self-motivated or respond well to clear goals and immediate feedback
- Families who value entrepreneurship, real-world skills, and outdoor challenges
- Children who are either behind (benefit from catch-up acceleration) or ahead (benefit from unlimited advancement)
- Families comfortable with technology-centric learning
- Parents who can afford tuition or live in strong school choice states with vouchers

Alpha may be less suitable for:
- Students who need significant teacher scaffolding or struggle with independent work
- Children with learning differences requiring specialized instruction (unless confirmed during campus visit)
- Families seeking traditional extracurriculars (sports teams, band, theater)
- Students passionate about creative writing, literature, or humanities (if these are priorities)
- Families uncomfortable with limited long-term outcome data

**Q: Is the "two-hour learning" claim real?**

A: Partially. Alpha's model does condense core academics significantly compared to traditional schools—students finish by lunch with no homework. However, some parents report actual academic time extends to 3-4 hours depending on the student. The efficiency gain is real, but "2 hours" is more marketing tagline than precise daily schedule. The better framing: students complete academics by midday rather than 3:30 PM.

**Q: What happens if we move or it doesn't work out?**

A: The documentation doesn't detail refund policies, mid-year transitions, or withdrawal processes. Alpha doesn't publish attrition rates or reasons families leave. These are important questions to ask admissions directly, including: What is your refund policy? What percentage of families return year-over-year? Can we transition mid-year if needed? What happens to records if we leave?

## Next Steps: If You're Interested

If Alpha School sounds like it might be a fit for your family, here's how to move forward:

1. **Take the online assessment:** Visit match.app.alpha.school to see if Alpha might suit your child's learning style

2. **Attend a Showcase Event:** Visit https://alpha.school/programs-events/ to find upcoming campus tours, info sessions, or open houses

3. **Contact admissions directly:**
   - General inquiries: admissions@alpha.school
   - Campus-specific contacts available at alpha.school
   - Primary contact method: https://alpha.school/learn-more/ (web form routes inquiries appropriately)

4. **Research school vouchers:** If cost is a concern, check your state's school choice program eligibility at your state education website

5. **Prepare questions:** Based on this guide's identified information gaps, prepare specific questions about:
   - Support for your child's particular needs
   - Writing instruction and assessment beyond multiple-choice
   - Attrition rates and refund policies
   - How afternoon workshop skills are assessed
   - What happens if your child struggles with the AI platform
   - College counseling and guidance process

6. **Schedule Shadow Day:** If the Showcase Event goes well, schedule your child's Shadow Day to experience the model firsthand and take MAP assessments

7. **Set realistic expectations:** Alpha offers a genuinely different model with compelling (though self-reported and not independently verified) results. Approach it as an educational experiment backed by substantial investment and promising early evidence—but not yet validated by long-term independent research.

## Final Thoughts

Alpha School represents a bold experiment in education. The core premise—that AI can personalize learning to achieve mastery faster, freeing time for hands-on life skills—has intuitive appeal and some supporting evidence. The founder's story (mother frustrated by boring school), the substantial investment (Joe Liemandt's ~\$1 billion), the concrete results (students running businesses, accelerated MAP growth), and the all-inclusive model (no fundraising, international trips included) paint a compelling picture.

At the same time, Alpha remains unproven by traditional standards. There's one graduating class of 12 students. Academic claims aren't independently verified. The platform isn't the cutting-edge AI tutor marketing suggests. Selection bias is significant. Writing instruction has documented gaps. Long-term outcomes are unknown. Regulatory bodies have called the model "untested."

For some families—particularly those who can afford it or access vouchers, who value entrepreneurship and real-world skills, whose children are either behind (benefit from acceleration) or ahead (benefit from unlimited advancement), and who embrace educational innovation—Alpha offers something genuinely different from both traditional schools and typical test-prep academies.

For others—particularly those seeking proven approaches, traditional extracurriculars, strong humanities emphasis, or extensive special education support—Alpha's trade-offs may not align with priorities.

The decision is ultimately personal, depending on your child's needs, your family's values, your financial situation, and your comfort with educational experimentation. This guide has provided the facts, the evidence, and the honest caveats. The rest is up to you.

If you visit, trust your instincts. Talk to current parents. Observe students during your tour. Ask the hard questions about what's not yet proven. And make the decision that feels right for your child and your family.
