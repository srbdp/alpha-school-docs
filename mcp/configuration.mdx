# Configuration

Add the Alpha School MCP Server to your MCP client's configuration file.

## Claude Code

Add to your `~/.claude.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpha-school": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["alpha-school-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
If you have existing MCP servers configured, add the `alpha-school` entry to your existing `mcpServers` object.
</Note>

## Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "alpha-school": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["alpha-school-mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Location: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "alpha-school": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["alpha-school-mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Global Installation

If you installed the package globally, you can use the direct command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpha-school": {
      "command": "alpha-school-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Verifying Configuration

After configuring:

1. Restart your MCP client (Claude Code or Claude Desktop)
2. The Alpha School tools should now be available
3. Try asking Claude about Alpha School to verify the connection

## Available Tools
