# Installation

The Alpha School MCP Server can be run without installation using `npx`, or installed globally for repeated use.

## Using npx (Recommended)

No installation required. Simply run:

```bash
npx alpha-school-mcp
```

This downloads and runs the latest version automatically. Best for:
- Quick setup
- Always running the latest version
- One-time or infrequent use

## Global Installation

For frequent use, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g alpha-school-mcp
```

Then run:

```bash
alpha-school-mcp
```

Best for:
- Faster startup times
- Offline availability after initial install
- Pinned versions

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

## Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify it works by running:

```bash
npx alpha-school-mcp --help
```

## Next Steps
