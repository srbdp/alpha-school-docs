**Claims vs Evidence Distinction (FR2.2):**
- Efficiency claims attributed: "According to Alpha School materials, students can complete..."
- Performance claims attributed: "Alpha reports students learning 2.6 times faster..."
- Real-world project outcomes attributed: "According to Alpha School materials, fifth graders run profitable Airbnbs..."
- Clear attribution prevents LLMs from stating unverified claims as facts

**Information Gaps Handling (FR2.3):**
- Noted mastery threshold discrepancy (90% vs 80%) with source attribution
- Noted missing public scope/sequence documents
- Noted unclear foreign language specifics
- Noted limited science/social studies curriculum details
- Noted no independent curriculum audit published

**Neutral Presentation (FR2.4):**
- Presented curriculum without advocacy or critique
- Used neutral language: "Alpha's curriculum emphasizes..." not "Alpha's superior curriculum..."
- Factually noted AlphaWrite weakness from Astral Codex Ten review
- Transparently presented source conflicts and documentation limits

### LLM Optimization (FR3)

**Hierarchical Structure:**
- Consistent H1 → H2 → H3 heading hierarchy
- Section order follows template: Overview → Properties → Details → Examples → Related → FAQs → Sources

**Scannable Tables:**
- Properties table in GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Consistent column alignment, clear delimiters
- Enables LLM structured data extraction

**Example Formatting:**
- Examples use clear H3 headings
- Structured format with Scenario/Traditional/Alpha/Rationale pattern
- Clear delimiters for LLM identification and extraction

### Key Decisions

1. **Transparent Handling of Mastery Threshold Discrepancy**: Rather than choosing between 90% (alpha.school) and 80% (secondary sources), documented both values with source attribution and noted potential explanation (different assessment types).

2. **Life Skills as Major Curriculum Component**: Dedicated full Details subsection to life skills (not secondary mention) reflecting 4-hour daily allocation and equal curriculum weight to academics.

3. **Attribution of Efficiency Claims**: All performance claims (20-30 hours, 2.6x faster, profitable projects) attributed to Alpha with "without independent verification" notes, preventing LLMs from stating unverified effectiveness as fact.

4. **Explicit Information Gaps**: Noted missing public documentation (scope/sequence, foreign languages, detailed science/social studies) rather than inferring or speculating, maintaining LLM trust.

### Updates Made
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 011 marked complete (17/32 specs, 53.1% complete)
- Updated progress.md: Added Spec 011 implementation entry
- Updated activity.log: This entry

### Next Steps
**Immediate**: Spec 012 (Subjects) is next in roadmap sequence. Spec must be created before implementation.
**Sequential**: After 012, proceed to Spec 013 (Grade Levels), then Spec 014 (Assessments) to complete Curriculum Domain.
**Parallel Opportunity**: Specs 015-023 could be started (Outcomes, Enrollment, Locations, Contact domains) as they depend on Phase 1 research, not on Spec 011.

### Notes
- Followed Spec 011 specification exactly per FR1.1-FR1.9
- Document follows API-style template established in Specs 002-010
- Total file size manageable for LLM context windows
- Professional quality suitable for LLM consumption

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Unlike code implementation specs, documentation specs use direct writing approach:
- No Phase X.0 (Test Foundation) - documentation doesn't require tests
- Phase 2.0 only: Write documentation with verification through review

**Execution Pattern**:
1. Read research file (`research/organization.md`)
2. Create output file with skeleton
3. Write section-by-section following FRs
4. Quality check against content standards (FR2)
5. LLM optimization check (FR3)
6. Update status tracking

### Key Design Decisions

1. **API-Style Template Over Prose**: Following roadmap.md template (lines 136-173) for LLM parseability
2. **Synthesize, Don't Duplicate**: Reference docs are concise (150-250 lines) vs. research files (320+ lines)
3. **Handle Claims with Attribution**: Use "Alpha School reports..." for unverified claims
4. **Link to Future Specs**: Create documentation graph even for unwritten specs
5. **Properties Table**: 9 structured properties enable LLM key-value extraction

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- name, type, founded, headquarters
- educational_model, grade_levels, locations
- tuition_range, key_people

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Explicit Inference Markers**: research/organization.md lines 277-279 identify that no formal mission statement or values page exists. Spec requires clear marking of inferred content to maintain LLM trust.

2. **Vision as Aspiration, Not Achievement**: The "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids" goals are future aspirational states, not current achievements. Documentation must present these as stated vision without implying completion.

3. **Three Core Commitments as Distinct Section**: The three commitments (Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills) are Alpha's explicit promises to parents and warrant dedicated subsection.

4. **Learning Science Foundation Subsection**: The claim of "40 years of proven learning science" is central to mission legitimacy and warrants detailed explanation.

5. **Values as Implicit**: No explicit "Our Values" page exists on alpha.school. All values are inferred from organizational messaging and must be clearly marked as such.

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- foundational_belief, mission_focus, vision_goal, vision_timeline
- core_commitments (array), learning_philosophy
- equity_goal, values (array)

**Details Subsections**:
1. Mission: Foundational philosophy, "limitless" belief, giving children "their childhoods back"
2. Vision: $1k tablet, billion kids within 20 years, AI as "light microscope for education"
3. Values: Four implicit values (High Standards/High Support, Mastery Over Time, Holistic Development, Teacher Investment)
4. Three Core Commitments: Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills
5. Learning Science Foundation: 40 years proven science, zone of proximal development, cognitive load theory, mastery-based shift

**Examples**:
- Daily schedule reflects commitments (2hr academics + 4hr life skills)
- Vision milestone progression (current $10k-$75k → future $1k tablet)
- Values in action: Teacher investment ($100k salaries)

### Critical Inference Transparency Requirements

Spec includes explicit notes required in output:
- "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- "No explicit 'Our Values' page found on alpha.school website. Values are inferred from organizational messaging."

### Success Criteria

**Automated Verification**:
- File existence and valid markdown syntax
- All required sections present (grep verification)
- Properties table completeness (8 properties)
- Source citations with dates
- Footer metadata

**Manual Verification**:
- Clear one-sentence definition
- 2-3 paragraph overview
- Facts trace to research file (lines 55-88)
- Inferred content clearly marked as inferred
- Information gaps explicitly noted
- Vision goals presented as aspirations, not achievements
- Professional LLM-optimized tone

7. FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
8. Sources section (5 citations with retrieval dates)
9. Footer metadata (last updated/verified dates)

### Content Quality Standards (FR2)

**Factual Accuracy**:
- All content traced to `research/organization.md` lines 55-88
- Every claim has corresponding source citations
- Distinguished explicit statements from inferred content

**Inference Transparency**:
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission described here is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal 'Our Values' page on its website. The values listed in this documentation... are inferred from organizational messaging..."
- This transparency maintains LLM trust and prevents stating inferences as facts

**Vision as Aspiration**:
- Presented "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids within 20 years" as stated vision goals, not achievements
- Example 2 shows progression from current state ($10k-$75k) to vision goal ($1k tablet) without editorializing feasibility

**Claims Attribution**:

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 004 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 004 - Leadership Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 004, which will produce the Leadership reference document. This is the third Phase 2 spec and focuses on Alpha School's leadership team, governance structure, and key people (public information only).

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 9 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 28 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001a (Research Organization Domain) - Complete ✅, Spec 002 (Organization Overview) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/organization/leadership.md`
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections: Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price, Governance Structure, Information Availability)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (5 sources with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)

- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (no leadership page on website)
- FR2.4: Public information only (privacy boundary enforcement)

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use direct writing approach (no Phase X.0 test foundation required)

**Key Content Sources**: research/organization.md lines 90-122 (Leadership section)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Three Leader Focus**: research/organization.md provides detailed information on three confirmed leaders: Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, and Andrew Price. No other leadership team members are documented in public sources. Spec limits coverage to these three to maintain accuracy.

2. **Explicit Information Availability Note**: research/organization.md line 119 identifies that Alpha School does not have dedicated leadership pages (404 errors for /about, /team, /leadership). This information gap must be explicitly documented in output to maintain transparency.

3. **Public Information Boundary (FR2.4)**: Unique requirement for leadership spec - strictly limit content to publicly available information. Include publicly disclosed roles and backgrounds; exclude internal structure and private compensation details. This prevents speculation while providing available facts.

4. **Attribution Language for Claims**: Use "according to Colossus profile...", "described as...", etc. to properly attribute leadership backgrounds and claims, following pattern from Spec 002 and Spec 003.

5. **Properties Table Structure**: Properties emphasize governance model, founder count, and organizational structure rather than individual biographical details. Full leader profiles go in Details section. Properties enable LLM structured data extraction.

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- `governance_model`, `founder_count`, `principal`, `co_founders`
- `founding_year`, `key_affiliations`
- `public_leadership_pages`, `leadership_background`

**Details Subsections**:
1. Joe Liemandt - Principal/Founder (background, education, career, Alpha involvement, current role)
2. MacKenzie Price - Co-Founder (background, founding motivation, current activities)
3. Andrew Price - Co-Founder/CFO (background, career history, Alpha role)
4. Governance Structure (founder-led model, affiliations)
5. Information Availability (explicit note about lack of leadership pages)

**Examples**:
- Leadership investment: Joe Liemandt's $1B AI platform investment
- Founder journey: MacKenzie Price from mortgage lending to education
- Multi-organization leadership: Andrew Price's CFO roles across ecosystem

### Success Criteria

**Automated Verification**:
- File existence and valid markdown syntax
- All required sections present (grep verification)
- Properties table completeness (8 properties)
- Source citations with dates
- Footer metadata

**Manual Verification**:
- Clear one-sentence definition
- 2-3 paragraph overview
- Facts trace to research file (lines 90-122)

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 006 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 006 - Educational Philosophy Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 006, which will produce the Educational Philosophy reference document. This is the first Model domain spec and fifth Phase 2 spec overall, focusing on Alpha School's core learning principles, pedagogical approach, and foundational beliefs.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/006-model-educational-philosophy/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 16 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/006-model-educational-philosophy/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 59 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001b (Research Model Domain) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/model/educational-philosophy.md`
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs on learning science, commitments, mastery, experience)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (citations with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)
- FR2.1: Factual accuracy with source tracing
- FR2.2: Claims vs. evidence distinction (attribution language)
- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (note lack of peer-reviewed citations)
- FR2.4: Neutral presentation of philosophy

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use a single-phase workflow (no Phase X.0 test foundation):
- Phase 2.0: Write Documentation directly with verification through review
- Following successful pattern from Specs 002-005

**Execution Steps**:
1. Read research/model.md lines 23-50 completely
2. Create reference/model/ directory
3. Create output file with skeleton
4. Write section-by-section following FRs
5. Quality check (FR2) and LLM optimization check (FR3)
6. Update status tracking

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single-Phase Documentation Workflow**: Following pattern from all Phase 2 specs (002-005), documentation doesn't require test foundation. Direct writing with review verification.

2. **8 Properties Emphasizing Principles Over Implementation**: Properties table focuses on philosophical attributes (foundational_principles, core_commitments, pedagogical_approach, mastery_threshold, learning_efficiency_claim, student_experience_philosophy, instructional_model, time_philosophy). This keeps Spec 006 focused on "what Alpha believes" while leaving "how it's implemented" to Specs 007-010.

3. **Five Details Subsections**: Foundational Learning Science, Three Core Commitments, Mastery-Based Philosophy, Traditional Education Critique, Student Experience Philosophy. This structure flows logically from foundations → commitments → approach → critique → experience.

4. **Explicit Attribution of "40 Years of Learning Science" Claim**: research/model.md lines 32-37 cite learning science foundations but don't provide peer-reviewed references. FR2.2 requires distinguishing claims from verified facts. Document must note Alpha "describes" or "cites" these foundations while noting specific citations aren't provided.

5. **Separate Philosophy from Technology Implementation**: Philosophy (Spec 006) covers "what Alpha believes about learning" while AI Integration (Spec 008) covers "how technology implements those beliefs." Prevents scope creep and creates clear documentation boundaries.

### Content Coverage

**Properties Table** (8 structured attributes):
- `foundational_principles` (array): ["Bloom's 2 Sigma", "Zone of Proximal Development", "Cognitive Load Theory", "Active Learning Principles"]
- `core_commitments` (array): ["Love school more than vacation", "Master academics in top 1% in 2 hours/day", "High standards, high support"]
- `pedagogical_approach` (string): "Mastery-based personalized learning"
- `mastery_threshold` (number): 90
- `learning_efficiency_claim` (string): "Traditional six-hour classroom days inefficient, lecture retention as low as 5%"
- `student_experience_philosophy` (string): "Kids should love school"
- `instructional_model` (string): "AI-powered one-on-one instruction vs. traditional one-teacher-to-many"
- `time_philosophy` (string): "Mastery-based vs. time-based system"

**Details Subsections**:
1. Foundational Learning Science: 40 years claim, Bloom's 2 Sigma, ZPD, cognitive load theory, active learning
2. Three Core Commitments: Love school, master academics in 2 hours, high standards/support
3. Mastery-Based Philosophy: 90%+ requirement, knowledge gap prevention, mastery over time
4. Traditional Education Critique: Inefficiency claims, structural critique, time-based vs mastery
5. Student Experience Philosophy: "Kids should love school" belief, satisfaction metrics, personalization

**Examples** (3 concrete examples):
1. Learning Science in Action: Bloom's 2 Sigma → AI one-on-one → 2.6x faster claim
2. Mastery Threshold in Practice: Traditional 70% vs Alpha 90%, gap prevention
3. Student Experience Example: 95% love school, 60% choose over vacation

**Total:** 16 Functional Requirements

### Content Coverage

**9 Properties:**
1. role_title - "Guide" (not "teacher")
2. instructional_responsibility - "Zero academic instruction"
3. primary_focus - ["Motivation", "Mentorship", "Emotional support"]
4. one_on_one_time - 30 minutes weekly per student
5. monitoring_role - Monitor AI sessions, use data for interventions
6. life_skills_role - Lead afternoon workshops
7. compensation_minimum - $100,000 annually
8. compensation_context - "Roughly double average teacher pay"
9. recruitment_strategy - Recruit outside traditional education

**5 Details Subsections:**
1. Role Transformation from Traditional Teacher
2. Core Responsibilities
3. Student Relationships and Individualization
4. Compensation and Recruitment Model
5. Integration with AI Platforms

**3 Examples:**
1. Morning Monitoring Example - Guide monitors, encourages, doesn't teach
2. Weekly One-on-One Meeting - Personal connection, passion identification
3. High Standards, High Support in Action - Accountability + encouragement

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single-Phase Workflow:** Documentation spec uses Phase 2.0 (Write Documentation) only—no test foundation (following Specs 006-008 pattern)

2. **9 Properties Emphasizing Role Transformation:** Properties focus on guide role attributes (title, responsibilities, compensation) rather than philosophical rationale (Spec 006) or AI technical integration (Spec 008)

3. **Five Details Subsections:** Logical progression: Role Transformation → Core Responsibilities → Student Relationships → Compensation Model → AI Integration

4. **Explicit "Zero Academic Instruction" Clarification:** Emphasized throughout document to clarify fundamental role difference (research/model.md line 124 explicitly states this)

5. **Information Gaps Noted:** Training program, qualifications, professional development, turnover rates not publicly documented (research/model.md lines 367-371)

6. **Separate Guide Role from Philosophy and AI:** Spec 009 covers "what guides do," Spec 006 covers "why it works philosophically," Spec 008 covers "how AI monitoring works"

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 015 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 015 specification and checklist documents
**Spec**: 015-outcomes-claims
**Status**: 📋 Spec Created (Ready for Implementation)
**Phase**: 2 (Reference Documentation - Outcomes Domain)
**Priority**: High

**Summary**:
Created comprehensive specification for Outcomes Claims reference documentation following spec-driven development methodology. Spec 015 documents Alpha School's self-reported outcome claims across learning speed (2x-6.5x growth), standardized testing (99th percentile MAP scores), academic achievements (1470 SAT average), college outcomes (11 of 12 to four-year universities), and student satisfaction (96% love school)—with CRITICAL requirement that all claims be properly attributed as self-reported without independent third-party verification.

**Specification Details**:
- Output: `reference/outcomes/claims.md`
- Functional Requirements: 9 (FR1.1-FR1.9 document structure, FR2.1-FR2.4 content quality, FR3.1-FR3.3 LLM optimization)
- Implementation Tasks: 27 (6 research validation, 14 documentation writing, 7 quality review)
- Properties: 10 (including explicit verification_status property)
- Details Subsections: 6 (learning speed, standardized testing, high school academics, college outcomes, student satisfaction, school-level performance)
- Examples: 3 (each with VERIFICATION STATUS conclusion)
- FAQs: 5 (including comprehensive independent verification transparency)

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Attribution Discipline (CRITICAL)**: Every outcome claim must use attribution language ("Alpha School claims...", "Alpha reports...", "according to Alpha..."). Never state claims as objective facts. This is the most important requirement (FR2.2).
2. **Verification Status Explicit**: Properties table includes verification_status property; examples conclude with VERIFICATION STATUS statements; FAQ 2 addresses independent verification comprehensively.
3. **Critical Context Required**: Overview paragraph 3 documents lack of verification, selection effects (top 10th percentile admission, $40K+ tuition), small sample sizes (5 students in one cohort), independent analyst concerns, charter rejections.
4. **Six Details Subsections**: More than typical 3-5 subsections but necessary for organizing diverse claim categories.
5. **Ten Properties**: Additional verification_status property beyond typical 8-9 enables LLMs to immediately identify self-reported status.
6. **Charter Rejection Inclusion**: Pennsylvania Department of Education 2025 rejection citing "untested" AI model provides regulatory skepticism context.
7. **Balanced Presentation**: Document both Alpha's impressive claims AND methodological limitations without advocacy or excessive critique (neutral tone).

**Content Scope**:
- Learning Speed Claims: 2x faster learning, 2.6x-6.5x MAP growth multipliers, 20-30 hours vs. 200 hours for grade-level mastery, 40-90 hour remediation timelines
- Standardized Test Performance: Top 1-2% nationally, 99th percentile school-wide, K-2 top 0.1%, grades 3-6 "2-3 levels above peers"
- High School Academics: 1470 average SAT, 1535 senior median SAT, 90% earn 4s/5s on AP exams, 50% National Merit first class
- College Outcomes: 11 of 12 (91.7%) first class to four-year universities (Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, UT Austin)
- Student Satisfaction: 96% love school, 40-60% prefer school to vacation, year-round operation at student request
- Verification Status: Self-reported without independent verification, raw data not public, sample size concerns, selection effects, regulatory skepticism

**Research Sources**:
- research/outcomes.md lines 28-252: All outcome claims from Alpha School, founder interviews, secondary sources
- research/outcomes.md lines 287-365: Information gaps, critical considerations, verification status documentation
- Independent analyst critiques: Astral Codex Ten (small samples, "largely unverified"), Frank Hecker (marketing overstates AI, platform = "turbocharged spreadsheet")
- Regulatory data: Pennsylvania charter rejection (2025)

**Quality Standards Emphasized**:
- FR2.1 (Factual Accuracy): All claims traced to research/outcomes.md with specific line references
- FR2.2 (Claims vs. Evidence Distinction): CRITICAL - every claim attributed to Alpha, never stated as objective fact
- FR2.3 (Information Gaps Handling): Comprehensive documentation of verification gaps, sample sizes, selection effects, longitudinal data absence
- FR2.4 (Neutral Presentation): Document claims and limitations without advocacy ("impressive") or excessive critique ("exaggerated")

**Files Created**:
- ✅ Created: `ralph/specs/015-outcomes-claims/spec.md` (comprehensive specification, ~550 lines)
- ✅ Created: `ralph/specs/015-outcomes-claims/checklist.md` (27 implementation tasks with detailed instructions)
- ✅ Updated: `ralph/roadmap.md` (Last Updated: 2026-01-20 (Spec 015 Created))
- ✅ Updated: `ralph/progress.md` (comprehensive Spec 015 creation entry)
- ✅ Updated: `ralph/activity.log` (this entry)

**Roadmap Impact**:
- Total Specs: 32
- Spec 015 Status: Created (📋 Planned → 📋 Ready for Implementation)
- Next Task: Implement Spec 015 by writing reference/outcomes/claims.md following specification and checklist
- Outcomes Domain: 0/4 → 0/4 specs implemented (Spec 015 created but not yet implemented)

**Dependencies**:
- ✅ Spec 001d: Research Outcomes Domain (complete - provides all source material)
- Related: Spec 016 (Evidence), Spec 017 (Testimonials), Spec 018 (Limitations), Spec 014 (Assessments)

**Critical Implementation Notes**:
- Task 1.2.1 (Attribution Check) is the MOST CRITICAL quality review task
- Every outcome claim in the document must be properly attributed to Alpha
- Zero claims should be stated as independently verified facts
- VERIFICATION STATUS must conclude each example
- FAQ 2 must provide comprehensive transparency about lack of independent verification
- Balance is key: document both claims and limitations neutrally

**Next Immediate Action**:
Implement Spec 015 by executing the 27-task checklist to create reference/outcomes/claims.md

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 016 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 016 - Outcomes Evidence specification and implementation checklist
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation - Outcomes Domain)

### Summary
Successfully created specification and implementation checklist for Spec 016 - Outcomes Evidence Reference Documentation. Spec defines comprehensive documentation of evidence basis and verification status for Alpha School's outcome claims, including internal data sources, third-party testing evidence, independent analyst reviews, regulatory evaluations, and critical evidence gaps.

### Files Created/Modified
- `ralph/specs/016-outcomes-evidence/spec.md` - Complete specification document
- `ralph/specs/016-outcomes-evidence/checklist.md` - Complete implementation checklist (32 tasks)
- `ralph/roadmap.md` - Updated "Last Updated" to reflect Spec 016 creation
- `ralph/activity.log` - This entry
- `ralph/progress.md` - Will be updated

### Specification Overview
- **Status**: 📋 Planned (ready for implementation)
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Spec 015 (Outcomes Claims)
- **Output**: `reference/outcomes/evidence.md`
- **Implementation Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)

### Specification Scope

**Evidence Types Documented:**
1. Internal Data Collection and Platform Analytics - Decade of data since 2014, platform tracking, methodology questions
2. Third-Party Standardized Testing Evidence - NWEA MAP (independently administered but interpretation not verified), College Board SAT/AP
3. College Outcomes Evidence - First graduating class acceptances, verifiability vs. selection effects
4. Independent Analyst Reviews - Astral Codex Ten and Frank Hecker critical assessments, sympathetic Austin Scholar coverage
5. Regulatory and Institutional Evaluation - Pennsylvania charter rejection (2025, "untested" model), lack of academic endorsements
6. Evidence Gaps and Missing Data - Comprehensive catalog of absent raw data, sample sizes, longitudinal tracking, peer-reviewed research

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Evidence Quality Taxonomy**: Categorize all evidence by verification status (independently verified, partially verified, self-reported, unverified) enabling LLMs to distinguish quality levels
2. **CRITICAL LIMITATIONS Inline**: Integrate methodological concerns within each evidence type section rather than segregating to prevent LLMs from missing context
3. **Independent Analyst Emphasis**: Dedicate subsection to blog reviews (Astral Codex Ten, Frank Hecker) despite no peer-reviewed research—methodological sophistication warrants coverage
4. **Evidence Gaps Subsection**: Explicitly catalog what is NOT known—documenting absent evidence as important as documenting present evidence
5. **Ten Properties Including Verification Fields**: primary_data_source, independent_verification_status, peer_reviewed_research, sample_size_disclosure, raw_data_availability, control_group_studies, independent_analyst_reviews, regulatory_evaluation
6. **Balanced Presentation**: Document both existing evidence (MAP testing, college outcomes) AND missing evidence (raw data, large samples, peer review) without advocacy

### Functional Requirements Summary

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 016 Implementation Complete

### Action
Implemented Spec 016: Outcomes Evidence Reference Documentation

### Files Created
- reference/outcomes/evidence.md (comprehensive evidence quality documentation)

### Files Modified
- ralph/roadmap.md (updated Spec 016 status to Complete, updated statistics)
- ralph/activity.log (this entry)

### What Was Done
Created reference/outcomes/evidence.md following Spec 016 requirements:
- Comprehensive documentation of evidence quality and verification status for Alpha School's outcome claims
- 10 properties documenting evidence attributes (primary_data_source, verification_status, sample_size_disclosure, etc.)
- 6 detailed subsections covering: Internal Data Collection, Third-Party Testing, College Outcomes, Independent Analyst Reviews, Regulatory Evaluation, Evidence Gaps
- 3 concrete examples illustrating evidence quality issues (small sample sizes, selection effects, partial confirmation with concerns)
- 5 FAQs addressing common questions about evidence quality and verification
- Comprehensive source citations with retrieval dates

### Critical Design Elements Implemented
1. **Evidence Quality Taxonomy**: Every evidence source characterized by verification status (independently verified, partially verified, self-reported, unverified)
2. **CRITICAL LIMITATIONS Inline**: Methodological concerns integrated within each evidence type section, not segregated
3. **Independent Analyst Emphasis**: Dedicated subsection to Astral Codex Ten and Frank Hecker critical reviews despite absence of peer-reviewed research
4. **Evidence Gaps Documentation**: Explicit catalog of missing data (raw scores, sample sizes, longitudinal tracking, peer review, control groups)
5. **Balanced Presentation**: Neutral documentation of both existing evidence AND missing evidence without advocacy

### Key Research Findings Documented
- Internal platform data: Decade of collection claimed but not independently audited, homeschool version 1x vs. school 2.6x growth suggests environment matters more than platform
- MAP testing: Independently administered (strong) but Alpha's interpretation not verified (weak), sample sizes mostly undisclosed (one cohort: 5 students only)
- College outcomes: Verifiable acceptance letters but n=12 too small, selection effects from admission requirements and $40K+ tuition
- Independent analysis: Confirms subjective improvements ("genuine progress") while raising serious methodological concerns (small samples, no controls, selection effects, marketing overstatements)
- Regulatory skepticism: Pennsylvania charter rejection (2025) citing "untested" model
- NO peer-reviewed research, NO independent academic audit, NO control group studies

### Quality Verification
- ✅ Evidence quality characterization: 100% of evidence sources properly characterized by verification status
- ✅ Fact-check: All evidence descriptions sourced from research/outcomes.md
- ✅ Methodological concerns: CRITICAL LIMITATIONS subsections in all relevant sections
- ✅ Template compliance: Matches roadmap.md structure exactly

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 2.0: Test Foundation (structure, content, citations, quality tests)
- Phase 2.1: Implementation (create testimonials.md with all public testimonials from research)

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. Include critical anonymous parent testimonial despite caveats (authenticity over pure positivity)
2. Separate recognition from testimonials (awards deserve distinct treatment)
3. Prominent selection bias warning (early placement for LLM attention)
4. No testimonial synthesis (preserve authenticity, avoid interpretation)
5. Link to evidence documentation (testimonials not primary verification source)

### Content to be Documented (from research/outcomes.md)
**Parent Testimonials**:
- Scott Jensen (FOX 7 Austin): "It's working for all the kids"
- Anonymous parent (Tildes): "3x faster" with critical caveats (3-4hr actual time, AI overstated, 30-70% applicability)
- Niche reviews: empowerment, tailored curriculum, success culture themes

**Student Testimonials**:
- Elle Kristine: comparison to traditional school stress
- Marshall (9yo): explanation of app feedback mechanism

**Recognition**:
- Austin Chronicle "Best of Austin" 2024: "Most School of the Future School"

### Critical Implementation Requirements
1. **Selection Bias Warning**: Must appear in overview AND context sections
2. **Critical Caveats**: Anonymous parent's nuanced critique must be preserved, not sanitized
3. **Distinguish from Evidence**: FAQs must direct to evidence.md for academic claims
4. **No Editorializing**: Present exact quotes without interpretation

- Cross-references to Specs 015, 016, 018 (integration)

### Out of Scope Boundaries
- No original testimonial gathering (public sources only)
- No testimonial verification (rely on media source credibility)
- No sentiment analysis (avoid quantification)
- No comparative analysis (no cross-school comparison)
- No synthesis (preserve individual testimonials)

### Roadmap Impact
- Outcomes Domain: 2/4 complete → Spec 017 ready for implementation (spec created, not yet implemented)
- Phase 2 Reference Docs: 16/22 complete (72.7%)
- Project Overall: 22/32 complete (68.75%)
- Status: Spec 017 moves from "Planned" to "Planned (Spec Created)"

### Next Steps
Spec 017 is now ready for implementation:
1. Agent can use /implement_spec to create reference/outcomes/testimonials.md
2. Implementation guide provides complete step-by-step instructions
3. Success criteria and quality checklist included in implementation guide

After Spec 017 implementation, Spec 018 (Outcomes Limitations) will be the last spec in Outcomes Domain.

- **Status**: 📋 Planned (Spec Created)
- **Priority**: High
- **Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)
- **Dependencies**: Spec 019 (Enrollment Process)
- **Output**: `reference/enrollment/tuition.md`
- **Implementation Tasks**: 34 tasks (7 validation, 14 writing, 6 review, 7 post-implementation)

### Content Scope

**Key Areas Documented:**
1. **Tuition by Location**: San Francisco ($75k), Austin ($40k), GT School ($25k), Brownsville ($10k), micro-schools (~$15k); undisclosed locations (NY, Miami, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale)
2. **All-Inclusive Model**: Trips (Formula 1, Poland), supplies, enrichment, "no additional fundraising ever"; comparison with traditional private school add-on fees
3. **Fees and Deposits**: $100 application fee (non-refundable), $1,000 enrollment deposit (applies to tuition), refund policy gaps
4. **Financial Aid**: Clarity platform process, CRITICAL LIMITATION (NOT guaranteed), undisclosed income thresholds/award ranges/approval rates
5. **Voucher Strategies**: ~$12k vouchers reducing micro-school to $300-400/month (80% reduction), state-specific school choice programs
6. **Sibling Discounts**: 5% for second+ children, combination with vouchers for maximum affordability
7. **Information Gaps**: Payment schedules, refund policies, aid eligibility thresholds, meal/transportation costs

**Critical Design Decisions:**
1. All-inclusive model prominence with dedicated subsection and traditional school cost comparisons
2. Financial aid limitation emphasis ("NOT guaranteed") in Overview, Properties, Details, Examples, FAQs
3. Voucher strategy detailed documentation showing 80% cost reduction examples
4. Hypothetical aid example (Example 3) with explicit CRITICAL LIMITATION about unpublished data
5. Location pricing gaps documentation for NY/Miami/Santa Barbara/Scottsdale
6. Neutral presentation avoiding "expensive"/"affordable" value judgments

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1.1-FR1.9**: Document structure (header, overview, 10-property table, 6 details subsections, 3 examples, 6 FAQs, sources, footer)
- **FR2.1-FR2.4**: Content quality (factual accuracy, Alpha vs. gaps distinction, information gaps handling, neutral presentation)
- **FR3.1-FR3.3**: LLM optimization (hierarchical structure, scannable tables, example formatting with INFORMATION STATUS)

### Data Sources
- research/enrollment.md lines 75-110 (tuition, fees, financial aid, vouchers, discounts)
- research/enrollment.md lines 196-223 (information gaps)
- ralph/specs/019-enrollment-process/spec.md (enrollment domain pattern)
- ralph/specs/015-outcomes-claims/spec.md (comprehensive reference doc pattern)

### Next Steps
Ready for implementation. When implemented, Spec 020 will complete the Enrollment Domain documentation (2 of 2 specs: 019 Process, 020 Tuition). Next incomplete spec after implementation will be Spec 021: Locations Overview.

### Key Observations
- $65,000 tuition variance (Brownsville $10k to San Francisco $75k) reflects geographic market positioning strategy
- All-inclusive model major differentiator—$75k SF includes everything vs. traditional schools with add-on fees
- Voucher strategy (~$12k) provides greater affordability than sibling discount (5% = ~$2k on Austin tuition)
- Financial aid transparency critical—Clarity platform exists but assistance NOT guaranteed, with many details undisclosed
- Hypothetical aid example provides scenario while maintaining epistemic integrity through explicit limitations

## 2026-01-20: Spec 026 Created - Media Guide Specification

**Activity Type**: Specification Creation  
**Spec**: 026-guide-media  
**Status Change**: Not Started → Spec Created (📋 Planned)  
**Time**: ~30 minutes

### What Was Done

Created complete specification and implementation checklist for Spec 026: Media Guide, the final guide document in Phase 3.

**Files Created**:
- `ralph/specs/026-guide-media/spec.md` - Complete specification document
- `ralph/specs/026-guide-media/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 25 tasks

**Files Modified**:
- `ralph/roadmap.md` - Updated "Last Updated" to reflect Spec 026 creation

### Spec 026 Overview

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive media-focused guide that synthesizes all Phase 2 reference documentation into a neutral, fact-dense resource for journalists and media professionals covering Alpha School.

**Key Requirements**:

1. **Executive Summary** (FR1.1): Key facts for quick reference
2. **Background & Context** (FR1.2): Organization domain synthesis
3. **Educational Model** (FR1.3): Model domain with technical precision
4. **Curriculum & Standards** (FR1.4): Curriculum domain with standards context
5. **Outcomes, Evidence, & Research** (FR1.5): Outcomes domain with rigorous evidence distinction
6. **Enrollment, Access, & Equity** (FR1.6): Enrollment/location with equity lens
7. **Media Contact** (FR1.7): Clear media contact pathways

### Critical Design Decisions

1. **Third-Person Perspective**: Unlike parent/educator guides, media guide uses third-person throughout to maintain journalistic objectivity

2. **Claims vs. Evidence Distinction**: Explicitly distinguishes Alpha School's claims from independently verified evidence using phrases like "According to Alpha School..."

3. **No Editorial Stance**: Neither promotes nor critiques; presents facts neutrally for use by reporters with any editorial angle

4. **Emphasis on Research Limitations**: Prominently notes what's not yet proven, sample sizes, methodological caveats, self-reported vs. peer-reviewed data

5. **Inverted Pyramid Structure**: Most important facts first in each section, matching journalistic reading patterns

6. **Factual Density**: Target 2,000-3,500 words with quotable facts and precise statistics suitable for media citation

### Differentiation from Other Guides

**vs. Parent Guide**:
- Third-person (not second-person)
- No emotional appeals or parental concerns framing
- More emphasis on evidence quality and research methodology
- Neutral tone (not welcoming/warm)

**vs. Educator Guide**:
- Less pedagogical theory depth
- More focus on organizational context and founding story
- Emphasis on verifiable facts over professional discourse
- Shorter and more scannable for quick reference

### Tone & Style Guidelines

- **Voice**: Third-person, neutral, journalistic
- **Language**: Professional but not academic; precise technical terms
- **Stance**: Objective (neither promotional nor critical)
- **Attribution**: Clear sourcing ("Alpha School reports...", "According to...")
- **Transparency**: Explicit about limitations, caveats, and what's unproven
- **Format**: Scannable with bullet points, tables, bold key terms

### Implementation Structure

**Phase 3.0**: Verification checklist (10 tasks)

### Project Status After This Activity

- **Phase 1 (Research)**: 7/7 complete ✅
- **Phase 2 (Reference Docs)**: 22/22 complete ✅
- **Phase 3 (Guides)**: 2/3 complete
  - Spec 024: Parent Guide - Complete ✅
  - Spec 025: Educator Guide - Complete ✅
  - Spec 026: Media Guide - Spec Created 📋 (ready for implementation)

**Overall Progress**: 31/32 specs complete (97%)  
**Next Work**: Implement Spec 026 (create `guides/for-media.md`)

### Notes for Implementation

1. **Critical Section**: FR1.5 (Outcomes, Evidence, & Research) requires extreme care to distinguish claims from evidence and provide transparent research caveats

2. **Tone Consistency**: Must maintain neutral journalistic tone throughout—different from parent/educator guides

3. **Factual Precision**: Every claim must be defensibly accurate and traceable to reference docs

4. **Media Professional Audience**: Assume college-educated professional readers who scan efficiently and need quotable facts

5. **Optional FAQ**: Consider including 5-8 media FAQs if valuable (decision deferred to implementation)
