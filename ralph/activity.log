## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 001 - Research & Source Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Created comprehensive specification and implementation checklist for conducting research and gathering all publicly available information about Alpha School with proper citations and source documentation.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md` - Full specification with FRs, implementation phases, and success criteria
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md` - Detailed task-by-task implementation checklist

### Spec Scope
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks all Phase 2 and Phase 3 specs)
- **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
- **Output**: `research/sources.md` and `research/sources.yaml`
- **Dependencies**: None (first spec in roadmap)
- **Blocks**: All 25 remaining specs (002-026)

### Key Decisions
1. Use web-research-doc-creator agent for automated research synthesis
2. Organize research by 7 documentation domains (Organization, Model, Curriculum, Outcomes, Enrollment, Locations, Contact)
3. Implement three-tier source credibility system (verified/likely/unverified)
4. Require complete metadata for every source (URL, dates, type, credibility)
5. Flag information gaps, conflicts, and sensitive topics for stakeholder review
6. Exclude non-public information, speculation, and unverified sources
7. Create both human-readable (MD) and machine-readable (YAML) outputs

### Research Methodology
- Primary sources: Official Alpha School website, social media, press releases, founder interviews
- Secondary sources: News articles, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, podcasts, public testimonials
- Tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, web-research-doc-creator agent
- Output: Structured markdown with citations and confidence levels

### Next Steps
After this spec is written (spec created, not implemented), the next action is to **implement Spec 001** by conducting the actual research using the web-research-doc-creator agent or manual research following the checklist.

### Notes
- Spec follows example-1 format structure
- Includes comprehensive source metadata requirements
- Documents all 7 organizational domains to research
- Provides detailed checklist with 26 tasks across 2 phases
- Establishes quality bar: all facts must have citations
- Creates foundation for all subsequent documentation work

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Unlike code implementation specs, documentation specs use direct writing approach:
- No Phase X.0 (Test Foundation) - documentation doesn't require tests
- Phase 2.0 only: Write documentation with verification through review

**Execution Pattern**:
1. Read research file (`research/organization.md`)
2. Create output file with skeleton
3. Write section-by-section following FRs
4. Quality check against content standards (FR2)
5. LLM optimization check (FR3)
6. Update status tracking

### Key Design Decisions

1. **API-Style Template Over Prose**: Following roadmap.md template (lines 136-173) for LLM parseability
2. **Synthesize, Don't Duplicate**: Reference docs are concise (150-250 lines) vs. research files (320+ lines)
3. **Handle Claims with Attribution**: Use "Alpha School reports..." for unverified claims
4. **Link to Future Specs**: Create documentation graph even for unwritten specs
5. **Properties Table**: 9 structured properties enable LLM key-value extraction

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- name, type, founded, headquarters
- educational_model, grade_levels, locations
- tuition_range, key_people

**Details Subsections**:
- Educational Model (2 Hour Learning)

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 003 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 003 - Mission, Vision, Values Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 003, which will produce the Mission, Vision, Values reference document. This is the second Phase 2 spec and focuses on Alpha School's driving purpose, long-term vision, and core values.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 9 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 103 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001a (Research Organization Domain) - Complete ✅, Spec 002 (Organization Overview) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/organization/mission.md`
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections: Mission, Vision, Values, Three Core Commitments, Learning Science Foundation)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (5 sources with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)
- FR2.1: Factual accuracy with explicit vs. inferred content distinction
- FR2.2: Claims vs. evidence distinction (vision as aspiration)
- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (no formal mission statement, no values page)
- FR2.4: Vision feasibility handling (present goals without editorializing)

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use direct writing approach (no Phase X.0 test foundation required)

**Key Content Sources**: research/organization.md lines 55-88 (Mission/Vision/Values section)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Explicit Inference Markers**: research/organization.md lines 277-279 identify that no formal mission statement or values page exists. Spec requires clear marking of inferred content to maintain LLM trust.

2. **Vision as Aspiration, Not Achievement**: The "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids" goals are future aspirational states, not current achievements. Documentation must present these as stated vision without implying completion.

3. **Three Core Commitments as Distinct Section**: The three commitments (Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills) are Alpha's explicit promises to parents and warrant dedicated subsection.

4. **Learning Science Foundation Subsection**: The claim of "40 years of proven learning science" is central to mission legitimacy and warrants detailed explanation.

5. **Values as Implicit**: No explicit "Our Values" page exists on alpha.school. All values are inferred from organizational messaging and must be clearly marked as such.

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- foundational_belief, mission_focus, vision_goal, vision_timeline
- core_commitments (array), learning_philosophy
- equity_goal, values (array)

**Details Subsections**:
1. Mission: Foundational philosophy, "limitless" belief, giving children "their childhoods back"
2. Vision: $1k tablet, billion kids within 20 years, AI as "light microscope for education"
3. Values: Four implicit values (High Standards/High Support, Mastery Over Time, Holistic Development, Teacher Investment)
4. Three Core Commitments: Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills
5. Learning Science Foundation: 40 years proven science, zone of proximal development, cognitive load theory, mastery-based shift

**Examples**:
- Daily schedule reflects commitments (2hr academics + 4hr life skills)
- Vision milestone progression (current $10k-$75k → future $1k tablet)
- Values in action: Teacher investment ($100k salaries)

### Critical Inference Transparency Requirements

Spec includes explicit notes required in output:
- "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- "No explicit 'Our Values' page found on alpha.school website. Values are inferred from organizational messaging."

### Success Criteria

**Automated Verification**:
- File existence and valid markdown syntax
- All required sections present (grep verification)
- Properties table completeness (8 properties)
- Source citations with dates
- Footer metadata

**Manual Verification**:

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 003 Implemented ✅

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Implemented Spec 003 - Mission, Vision, Values Reference Documentation
**Type**: Reference Documentation Implementation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created the second Phase 2 reference documentation file by synthesizing research findings from `research/organization.md` (lines 55-88) into a structured, LLM-optimized API-style reference document answering "What drives Alpha School?"

### Files Created
- `reference/organization/mission.md` - 189 lines of structured API-style documentation

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use direct writing approach (no Phase X.0 test foundation required)
- Read research file focusing on Mission/Vision/Values section
- Created output file following all 9 Functional Requirements
- Verified content quality (FR2) with special attention to inference transparency
- Verified LLM optimization (FR3)
- Updated all tracking files

### Document Structure (FR1)

**9 Required Sections**:
1. H1 title with one-sentence blockquote definition
2. Overview section (3 paragraphs on philosophy, learning science, democratization)
3. Properties table (8 structured attributes)
4. Details section (5 subsections: Mission, Vision, Values, Three Core Commitments, Learning Science Foundation)
5. Examples section (3 concrete examples)
6. Related documentation links (5 links to related specs)
7. FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
8. Sources section (5 citations with retrieval dates)
9. Footer metadata (last updated/verified dates)

### Content Quality Standards (FR2)

**Factual Accuracy**:
- All content traced to `research/organization.md` lines 55-88
- Every claim has corresponding source citations
- Distinguished explicit statements from inferred content

**Inference Transparency**:
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission described here is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal 'Our Values' page on its website. The values listed in this documentation... are inferred from organizational messaging..."
- This transparency maintains LLM trust and prevents stating inferences as facts

**Vision as Aspiration**:
- Presented "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids within 20 years" as stated vision goals, not achievements
- Example 2 shows progression from current state ($10k-$75k) to vision goal ($1k tablet) without editorializing feasibility

**Claims Attribution**:
- Self-reported claims properly attributed when referenced (e.g., "Alpha School claims students learn 2.6x faster")
- No speculation beyond research findings

### LLM Optimization (FR3)

**Hierarchical Structure**:
- 20 total headings in H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy
- Enables efficient LLM parsing of document structure

**Scannable Properties Table**:
- GitHub Flavored Markdown table with 8 key-value pairs
- Includes arrays for core_commitments and values
- Enables direct LLM extraction of structured attributes

**Example Formatting**:
- 3 examples with clear H3 delimiters
- Concrete instances: daily schedule, vision progression, values in action

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Inference Markers**: Critical requirement from Spec 003 - explicitly state when content is inferred vs. explicitly published to maintain documentation trustworthiness

2. **Five-Part Details Section**: Organized as Mission → Vision → Values → Three Core Commitments → Learning Science Foundation to provide logical flow from foundational beliefs to supporting evidence

3. **Three Core Commitments Subsection**: Dedicated subsection for Alpha's explicit promises to parents (Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills) as these are prominently featured on alpha.school

4. **Learning Science Foundation**: Detailed explanation of "40 years of proven learning science" claim including zone of proximal development, cognitive load theory, and Bloom's 2 Sigma to ground mission in pedagogical research

5. **Vision Without Evaluation**: Presented ambitious vision goals ($1k tablet, billion kids) as stated aspirations without analyzing feasibility or likelihood
