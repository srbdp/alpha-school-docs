## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 001 - Research & Source Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Created comprehensive specification and implementation checklist for conducting research and gathering all publicly available information about Alpha School with proper citations and source documentation.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md` - Full specification with FRs, implementation phases, and success criteria
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md` - Detailed task-by-task implementation checklist

### Spec Scope
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks all Phase 2 and Phase 3 specs)
- **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
- **Output**: `research/sources.md` and `research/sources.yaml`
- **Dependencies**: None (first spec in roadmap)
- **Blocks**: All 25 remaining specs (002-026)

### Key Decisions
1. Use web-research-doc-creator agent for automated research synthesis
2. Organize research by 7 documentation domains (Organization, Model, Curriculum, Outcomes, Enrollment, Locations, Contact)
3. Implement three-tier source credibility system (verified/likely/unverified)
4. Require complete metadata for every source (URL, dates, type, credibility)
5. Flag information gaps, conflicts, and sensitive topics for stakeholder review
6. Exclude non-public information, speculation, and unverified sources
7. Create both human-readable (MD) and machine-readable (YAML) outputs

### Research Methodology
- Primary sources: Official Alpha School website, social media, press releases, founder interviews
- Secondary sources: News articles, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, podcasts, public testimonials
- Tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, web-research-doc-creator agent
- Output: Structured markdown with citations and confidence levels

### Next Steps
After this spec is written (spec created, not implemented), the next action is to **implement Spec 001** by conducting the actual research using the web-research-doc-creator agent or manual research following the checklist.

### Notes
- Spec follows example-1 format structure
- Includes comprehensive source metadata requirements
- Documents all 7 organizational domains to research
- Provides detailed checklist with 26 tasks across 2 phases
- Establishes quality bar: all facts must have citations
- Creates foundation for all subsequent documentation work
