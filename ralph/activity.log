## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 001 - Research & Source Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Created comprehensive specification and implementation checklist for conducting research and gathering all publicly available information about Alpha School with proper citations and source documentation.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md` - Full specification with FRs, implementation phases, and success criteria
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md` - Detailed task-by-task implementation checklist

### Spec Scope
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks all Phase 2 and Phase 3 specs)
- **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
- **Output**: `research/sources.md` and `research/sources.yaml`
- **Dependencies**: None (first spec in roadmap)
- **Blocks**: All 25 remaining specs (002-026)

### Key Decisions
1. Use web-research-doc-creator agent for automated research synthesis
2. Organize research by 7 documentation domains (Organization, Model, Curriculum, Outcomes, Enrollment, Locations, Contact)
3. Implement three-tier source credibility system (verified/likely/unverified)
4. Require complete metadata for every source (URL, dates, type, credibility)
5. Flag information gaps, conflicts, and sensitive topics for stakeholder review
6. Exclude non-public information, speculation, and unverified sources
7. Create both human-readable (MD) and machine-readable (YAML) outputs

### Research Methodology
- Primary sources: Official Alpha School website, social media, press releases, founder interviews
- Secondary sources: News articles, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, podcasts, public testimonials
- Tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, web-research-doc-creator agent
- Output: Structured markdown with citations and confidence levels

### Next Steps
After this spec is written (spec created, not implemented), the next action is to **implement Spec 001** by conducting the actual research using the web-research-doc-creator agent or manual research following the checklist.

### Notes
- Spec follows example-1 format structure
- Includes comprehensive source metadata requirements
- Documents all 7 organizational domains to research
- Provides detailed checklist with 26 tasks across 2 phases
- Establishes quality bar: all facts must have citations
- Creates foundation for all subsequent documentation work

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Unlike code implementation specs, documentation specs use direct writing approach:
- No Phase X.0 (Test Foundation) - documentation doesn't require tests
- Phase 2.0 only: Write documentation with verification through review

**Execution Pattern**:
1. Read research file (`research/organization.md`)
2. Create output file with skeleton
3. Write section-by-section following FRs
4. Quality check against content standards (FR2)
5. LLM optimization check (FR3)
6. Update status tracking

### Key Design Decisions

1. **API-Style Template Over Prose**: Following roadmap.md template (lines 136-173) for LLM parseability
2. **Synthesize, Don't Duplicate**: Reference docs are concise (150-250 lines) vs. research files (320+ lines)
3. **Handle Claims with Attribution**: Use "Alpha School reports..." for unverified claims
4. **Link to Future Specs**: Create documentation graph even for unwritten specs
5. **Properties Table**: 9 structured properties enable LLM key-value extraction

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- name, type, founded, headquarters
- educational_model, grade_levels, locations
- tuition_range, key_people

**Details Subsections**:
- Educational Model (2 Hour Learning)

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 003 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 003 - Mission, Vision, Values Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 003, which will produce the Mission, Vision, Values reference document. This is the second Phase 2 spec and focuses on Alpha School's driving purpose, long-term vision, and core values.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 9 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 103 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001a (Research Organization Domain) - Complete ✅, Spec 002 (Organization Overview) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/organization/mission.md`
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections: Mission, Vision, Values, Three Core Commitments, Learning Science Foundation)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (5 sources with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)
- FR2.1: Factual accuracy with explicit vs. inferred content distinction
- FR2.2: Claims vs. evidence distinction (vision as aspiration)
- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (no formal mission statement, no values page)
- FR2.4: Vision feasibility handling (present goals without editorializing)

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use direct writing approach (no Phase X.0 test foundation required)

**Key Content Sources**: research/organization.md lines 55-88 (Mission/Vision/Values section)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Explicit Inference Markers**: research/organization.md lines 277-279 identify that no formal mission statement or values page exists. Spec requires clear marking of inferred content to maintain LLM trust.

2. **Vision as Aspiration, Not Achievement**: The "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids" goals are future aspirational states, not current achievements. Documentation must present these as stated vision without implying completion.

3. **Three Core Commitments as Distinct Section**: The three commitments (Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills) are Alpha's explicit promises to parents and warrant dedicated subsection.

4. **Learning Science Foundation Subsection**: The claim of "40 years of proven learning science" is central to mission legitimacy and warrants detailed explanation.

5. **Values as Implicit**: No explicit "Our Values" page exists on alpha.school. All values are inferred from organizational messaging and must be clearly marked as such.

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- foundational_belief, mission_focus, vision_goal, vision_timeline
- core_commitments (array), learning_philosophy
- equity_goal, values (array)

**Details Subsections**:
1. Mission: Foundational philosophy, "limitless" belief, giving children "their childhoods back"
2. Vision: $1k tablet, billion kids within 20 years, AI as "light microscope for education"
3. Values: Four implicit values (High Standards/High Support, Mastery Over Time, Holistic Development, Teacher Investment)
4. Three Core Commitments: Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills
5. Learning Science Foundation: 40 years proven science, zone of proximal development, cognitive load theory, mastery-based shift

**Examples**:
- Daily schedule reflects commitments (2hr academics + 4hr life skills)
- Vision milestone progression (current $10k-$75k → future $1k tablet)
- Values in action: Teacher investment ($100k salaries)

### Critical Inference Transparency Requirements

Spec includes explicit notes required in output:
- "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- "No explicit 'Our Values' page found on alpha.school website. Values are inferred from organizational messaging."

### Success Criteria

**Automated Verification**:
- File existence and valid markdown syntax
- All required sections present (grep verification)
- Properties table completeness (8 properties)
- Source citations with dates

6. Related documentation links (5 links to related specs)
7. FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
8. Sources section (5 citations with retrieval dates)
9. Footer metadata (last updated/verified dates)

### Content Quality Standards (FR2)

**Factual Accuracy**:
- All content traced to `research/organization.md` lines 55-88
- Every claim has corresponding source citations
- Distinguished explicit statements from inferred content

**Inference Transparency**:
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission described here is inferred from organizational messaging..."
- Added explicit note: "Alpha School does not publish a formal 'Our Values' page on its website. The values listed in this documentation... are inferred from organizational messaging..."
- This transparency maintains LLM trust and prevents stating inferences as facts

**Vision as Aspiration**:
- Presented "$1,000 tablet" and "billion kids within 20 years" as stated vision goals, not achievements
- Example 2 shows progression from current state ($10k-$75k) to vision goal ($1k tablet) without editorializing feasibility

**Claims Attribution**:
- Self-reported claims properly attributed when referenced (e.g., "Alpha School claims students learn 2.6x faster")

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 004 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 004 - Leadership Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 004, which will produce the Leadership reference document. This is the third Phase 2 spec and focuses on Alpha School's leadership team, governance structure, and key people (public information only).

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 9 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 28 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001a (Research Organization Domain) - Complete ✅, Spec 002 (Organization Overview) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/organization/leadership.md`
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections: Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price, Governance Structure, Information Availability)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (5 sources with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)
- FR2.1: Factual accuracy with source tracing
- FR2.2: Claims vs. evidence distinction (attribution language)
- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (no leadership page on website)
- FR2.4: Public information only (privacy boundary enforcement)

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use direct writing approach (no Phase X.0 test foundation required)

**Key Content Sources**: research/organization.md lines 90-122 (Leadership section)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Three Leader Focus**: research/organization.md provides detailed information on three confirmed leaders: Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, and Andrew Price. No other leadership team members are documented in public sources. Spec limits coverage to these three to maintain accuracy.

2. **Explicit Information Availability Note**: research/organization.md line 119 identifies that Alpha School does not have dedicated leadership pages (404 errors for /about, /team, /leadership). This information gap must be explicitly documented in output to maintain transparency.

3. **Public Information Boundary (FR2.4)**: Unique requirement for leadership spec - strictly limit content to publicly available information. Include publicly disclosed roles and backgrounds; exclude internal structure and private compensation details. This prevents speculation while providing available facts.

4. **Attribution Language for Claims**: Use "according to Colossus profile...", "described as...", etc. to properly attribute leadership backgrounds and claims, following pattern from Spec 002 and Spec 003.

5. **Properties Table Structure**: Properties emphasize governance model, founder count, and organizational structure rather than individual biographical details. Full leader profiles go in Details section. Properties enable LLM structured data extraction.

### Content Coverage

**Properties to Document**:
- `governance_model`, `founder_count`, `principal`, `co_founders`
- `founding_year`, `key_affiliations`
- `public_leadership_pages`, `leadership_background`

**Details Subsections**:
1. Joe Liemandt - Principal/Founder (background, education, career, Alpha involvement, current role)
2. MacKenzie Price - Co-Founder (background, founding motivation, current activities)
3. Andrew Price - Co-Founder/CFO (background, career history, Alpha role)
4. Governance Structure (founder-led model, affiliations)
5. Information Availability (explicit note about lack of leadership pages)

**Examples**:
- Leadership investment: Joe Liemandt's $1B AI platform investment
- Founder journey: MacKenzie Price from mortgage lending to education
- Multi-organization leadership: Andrew Price's CFO roles across ecosystem

### Success Criteria

**Automated Verification**:
- File existence and valid markdown syntax
- All required sections present (grep verification)
- Properties table completeness (8 properties)
- Source citations with dates
- Footer metadata

**Manual Verification**:
- Clear one-sentence definition
- 2-3 paragraph overview
- Facts trace to research file (lines 90-122)
- Three leader profiles complete and accurate
- Public information boundary respected
- Information gaps explicitly noted

- **Phase 1**: 100% complete (7/7) ✅
- **Phase 2**: 2/22 implemented (9%), 1 spec created (Spec 004)

### Notes

- Third Phase 2 spec created
- Follows established spec patterns from Spec 002 and Spec 003
- Emphasizes public information boundary unique to leadership documentation
- Handles information gaps with explicit transparency (no leadership pages on website)
- Checklist has 28 tasks (slightly more than Spec 002's 22 due to three separate leader profiles)

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 006 Created

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-20
**Action**: Created Spec 006 - Educational Philosophy Reference Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 2 (Reference Documentation)

### Summary
Created comprehensive technical specification for Spec 006, which will produce the Educational Philosophy reference document. This is the first Model domain spec and fifth Phase 2 spec overall, focusing on Alpha School's core learning principles, pedagogical approach, and foundational beliefs.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/006-model-educational-philosophy/spec.md` - Complete technical specification with 16 Functional Requirements
- `ralph/specs/006-model-educational-philosophy/checklist.md` - Implementation checklist with 59 tasks

### Specification Details

**Dependencies**: Spec 001b (Research Model Domain) - Complete ✅
**Output**: `reference/model/educational-philosophy.md`
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Small (~1 hour)

### Functional Requirements Structure

**FR1: Document Structure** (9 sub-requirements)
- FR1.1: Header and definition (H1 + blockquote)
- FR1.2: Overview section (2-3 paragraphs on learning science, commitments, mastery, experience)
- FR1.3: Properties table (8 required properties)
- FR1.4: Details section (5 subsections)
- FR1.5: Examples section (3 concrete examples)
- FR1.6: Related documentation links
- FR1.7: FAQs section (5 Q&A pairs)
- FR1.8: Sources section (citations with dates)
- FR1.9: Footer metadata (last updated/verified)

**FR2: Content Quality Standards** (4 sub-requirements)
- FR2.1: Factual accuracy with source tracing
- FR2.2: Claims vs. evidence distinction (attribution language)
- FR2.3: Information gaps handling (note lack of peer-reviewed citations)
- FR2.4: Neutral presentation of philosophy

**FR3: LLM Optimization** (3 sub-requirements)
- FR3.1: Hierarchical structure (H1→H2→H3)
- FR3.2: Scannable tables (GFM markdown)
- FR3.3: Example formatting (clear delimiters)

### Implementation Approach

**Single-Phase Workflow**: Documentation specs use a single-phase workflow (no Phase X.0 test foundation):
- Phase 2.0: Write Documentation directly with verification through review
- Following successful pattern from Specs 002-005

**Execution Steps**:
1. Read research/model.md lines 23-50 completely
2. Create reference/model/ directory
3. Create output file with skeleton
4. Write section-by-section following FRs
5. Quality check (FR2) and LLM optimization check (FR3)
6. Update status tracking

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single-Phase Documentation Workflow**: Following pattern from all Phase 2 specs (002-005), documentation doesn't require test foundation. Direct writing with review verification.

2. **8 Properties Emphasizing Principles Over Implementation**: Properties table focuses on philosophical attributes (foundational_principles, core_commitments, pedagogical_approach, mastery_threshold, learning_efficiency_claim, student_experience_philosophy, instructional_model, time_philosophy). This keeps Spec 006 focused on "what Alpha believes" while leaving "how it's implemented" to Specs 007-010.

3. **Five Details Subsections**: Foundational Learning Science, Three Core Commitments, Mastery-Based Philosophy, Traditional Education Critique, Student Experience Philosophy. This structure flows logically from foundations → commitments → approach → critique → experience.

4. **Explicit Attribution of "40 Years of Learning Science" Claim**: research/model.md lines 32-37 cite learning science foundations but don't provide peer-reviewed references. FR2.2 requires distinguishing claims from verified facts. Document must note Alpha "describes" or "cites" these foundations while noting specific citations aren't provided.

5. **Separate Philosophy from Technology Implementation**: Philosophy (Spec 006) covers "what Alpha believes about learning" while AI Integration (Spec 008) covers "how technology implements those beliefs." Prevents scope creep and creates clear documentation boundaries.

### Content Coverage

**Properties Table** (8 structured attributes):
- `foundational_principles` (array): ["Bloom's 2 Sigma", "Zone of Proximal Development", "Cognitive Load Theory", "Active Learning Principles"]
- `core_commitments` (array): ["Love school more than vacation", "Master academics in top 1% in 2 hours/day", "High standards, high support"]
- `pedagogical_approach` (string): "Mastery-based personalized learning"
- `mastery_threshold` (number): 90
- `learning_efficiency_claim` (string): "Traditional six-hour classroom days inefficient, lecture retention as low as 5%"
- `student_experience_philosophy` (string): "Kids should love school"
- `instructional_model` (string): "AI-powered one-on-one instruction vs. traditional one-teacher-to-many"
- `time_philosophy` (string): "Mastery-based vs. time-based system"

**Details Subsections**:
1. Foundational Learning Science: 40 years claim, Bloom's 2 Sigma, ZPD, cognitive load theory, active learning
2. Three Core Commitments: Love school, master academics in 2 hours, high standards/support
3. Mastery-Based Philosophy: 90%+ requirement, knowledge gap prevention, mastery over time
4. Traditional Education Critique: Inefficiency claims, structural critique, time-based vs mastery
5. Student Experience Philosophy: "Kids should love school" belief, satisfaction metrics, personalization

**Examples** (3 concrete examples):
1. Learning Science in Action: Bloom's 2 Sigma → AI one-on-one → 2.6x faster claim
2. Mastery Threshold in Practice: Traditional 70% vs Alpha 90%, gap prevention
3. Student Experience Example: 95% love school, 60% choose over vacation
