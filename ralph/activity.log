## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001 Created

**Action**: Created Spec 001 - Research & Source Documentation
**Type**: Spec Creation
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Created comprehensive specification and implementation checklist for conducting research and gathering all publicly available information about Alpha School with proper citations and source documentation.

### Files Created
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md` - Full specification with FRs, implementation phases, and success criteria
- `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md` - Detailed task-by-task implementation checklist

### Spec Scope
- **Priority**: Critical (blocks all Phase 2 and Phase 3 specs)
- **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
- **Output**: `research/sources.md` and `research/sources.yaml`
- **Dependencies**: None (first spec in roadmap)
- **Blocks**: All 25 remaining specs (002-026)

### Key Decisions
1. Use web-research-doc-creator agent for automated research synthesis
2. Organize research by 7 documentation domains (Organization, Model, Curriculum, Outcomes, Enrollment, Locations, Contact)
3. Implement three-tier source credibility system (verified/likely/unverified)
4. Require complete metadata for every source (URL, dates, type, credibility)
5. Flag information gaps, conflicts, and sensitive topics for stakeholder review
6. Exclude non-public information, speculation, and unverified sources
7. Create both human-readable (MD) and machine-readable (YAML) outputs

### Research Methodology
- Primary sources: Official Alpha School website, social media, press releases, founder interviews
- Secondary sources: News articles, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, podcasts, public testimonials
- Tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, web-research-doc-creator agent
- Output: Structured markdown with citations and confidence levels

### Next Steps
After this spec is written (spec created, not implemented), the next action is to **implement Spec 001** by conducting the actual research using the web-research-doc-creator agent or manual research following the checklist.

### Notes
- Spec follows example-1 format structure
- Includes comprehensive source metadata requirements
- Documents all 7 organizational domains to research
- Provides detailed checklist with 26 tasks across 2 phases
- Establishes quality bar: all facts must have citations
- Creates foundation for all subsequent documentation work

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001a Implemented

**Action**: Implemented Spec 001a - Research Organization Domain
**Type**: Spec Implementation (Phase 1 Research)
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Successfully researched and documented all publicly available information about Alpha School's Organization domain, including overview, mission/vision, leadership, and history. Used web-research-doc-creator agent to gather information from primary and secondary sources.

### Output File Created
- `research/organization.md` - 320 lines, 17KB comprehensive research document

### Research Completed

**Primary Sources Researched:**
- alpha.school homepage
- alpha.school/2-hour-learning page
- alpha.school/faq page
- LinkedIn company page
- Twitter/X account (@AlphaSchoolATX)

**Secondary Sources Researched:**
- 2hourlearning.com/founder/
- Colossus (Joe Liemandt profile)
- Newsweek, SF Standard, Jacobin articles

### Key Findings
- **Overview**: AI-powered K-12 private school with "2 Hour Learning" model
- **Mission**: Implicit mission documented (no formal statement found)
- **Vision**: Sub-$1,000 tablet for a billion kids within 20 years
- **Values**: Inferred from messaging (no explicit values page)
- **Leadership**: Joe Liemandt (founder/CEO), MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price - full bios documented
- **History**: Founded 2014, first campus 2016, milestones through 2025

### Information Gaps Identified
- No explicit mission/vision/values statements
- Complete leadership team beyond founders
- Total enrollment numbers
- Full campus list
- Accreditation status

### Notes Captured
- Source conflicts (employee count, founder attribution)
- Criticisms of "2 Hour Learning" claims
- Potential conflicts of interest in media coverage
- Sensitive topics (charter rejections, tuition costs, unverified claims)

### Updates Made
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 001a marked complete, Spec 001 in progress
- Updated ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md
- Updated ralph/specs/001a-research-organization/checklist.md

### Next Steps
Continue with remaining research sub-specs (001b-001g) to complete Phase 1 research

## 2026-01-20 - Spec 001b Implemented

**Action**: Implemented Spec 001b - Research Model Domain
**Type**: Spec Implementation (Phase 1 Research)
**Phase**: Phase 1 (Research)

### Summary
Successfully researched and documented all publicly available information about Alpha School's Model domain, including educational philosophy, 2-hour learning model, AI integration, human instruction role, and daily schedule. Used web-research-doc-creator agent to gather information from primary and secondary sources.

### Output File Created
- `research/model.md` - Comprehensive research document with 10 sources

### Research Completed

**Primary Sources Researched:**
- alpha.school homepage
- alpha.school/the-program/ page
- Alpha School blog
- 2hourlearning.com/founder/

**Secondary Sources Researched:**
- CBS News coverage
- Newsweek article
- Cognitive Revolution Podcast (Joe Liemandt interview)
- Modern Wisdom Podcast (MacKenzie Price interview)
- AEI Report Card Podcast
- Michael Horn Substack analysis

### Key Findings
- **Educational Philosophy**: Three core commitments (love school, master academics in 2 hours, high standards/support), based on Bloom's 2 Sigma, zone of proximal development, mastery-based learning
- **2-Hour Learning Model**: 2 hours AI-powered academics + 2.5-4 hours life skills, claims 2.6x faster learning
- **AI Integration**: Platforms "Time Back" and "Dash", uses IXL/Khan Academy, vision models, NOT chatbots
- **Human Instruction**: "Guides" provide mentorship not instruction, $100k+ salaries, 30 min/week 1:1 time
- **Daily Schedule**: Goal-setting, 2-hour academic block (4x25 min Pomodoros), lunch, afternoon life skills

### Information Gaps Identified
- No peer-reviewed studies validating the approach
- Only 1 graduating class (12 students) documented
- Guide training program details
- Admission criteria/selectivity
- Attrition data

### Notes Captured
- Claims vs. verified facts clearly distinguished
- Self-reported metrics documented with appropriate caveats
- Source conflicts noted

### Updates Made
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 001b marked complete, stats updated (2/32 complete, 6%)
- Updated ralph/specs/001b-research-model/spec.md status

### Next Steps
Continue with Spec 001c: Research Curriculum Domain
