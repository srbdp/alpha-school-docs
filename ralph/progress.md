### Spec 001 Created ✅

**Status**: Spec created, ready for implementation

**What was done**:
- Created Spec 001 specification document (`ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md`)
- Created Spec 001 implementation checklist (`ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md`)
- Updated roadmap.md to reflect Spec 001 status as "In Progress"
- Logged activity in activity.log

**Key Details**:
- Spec 001 focuses on research and source documentation
- This is the foundation spec - all other specs depend on it
- Spec defines methodology for gathering public Alpha School information with citations
- Output will be `research/sources.md` and `research/sources.yaml`

**Next Action**:
Implement Spec 001 by conducting the actual research. This can be done by:
1. Using the web-research-doc-creator agent (recommended for efficiency)
2. Following the manual checklist in `ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md`

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
