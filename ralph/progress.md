## 2026-01-20 (Later) - Spec 004 Created ✅

**Status**: Spec created, ready for implementation

**What was done**:
- Created Spec 004 specification document (`ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/spec.md`)
- Created Spec 004 implementation checklist (`ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md`)
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 004 status changed from 📋 Planned to 🚧 In Progress
- Updated stats: In Progress: 1 (3.1%), Planned: 22 (68.8%)
- Logged activity in activity.log
- Updated progress.md with this entry

**Key Details**:
- Spec 004 focuses on Leadership reference documentation
- Third Phase 2 spec (following Spec 002 and Spec 003)
- Dependencies: Spec 001a (Complete ✅), Spec 002 (Complete ✅)
- Output: `reference/organization/leadership.md`
- Priority: High
- Effort: Small (~1 hour)

**Specification Structure**:
- 9 Functional Requirements organized in 3 groups (FR1: Structure, FR2: Quality, FR3: LLM Optimization)
- 28 implementation tasks in checklist
- Single-phase documentation workflow (no test foundation phase)
- Complete output template provided
- Success criteria defined (automated + manual verification)

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Three Leader Focus**: research/organization.md lines 90-122 provides detailed information on three confirmed leaders (Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price). Spec limits coverage to these three documented leaders.
2. **Explicit Information Availability Note**: research/organization.md line 119 states Alpha School does not have dedicated leadership pages (404 errors). This information gap must be explicitly documented for transparency.
3. **Public Information Boundary (FR2.4)**: Unique requirement for leadership - strictly limit to publicly available information. Include disclosed roles/backgrounds; exclude internal structure and private compensation.
4. **Attribution Language**: Use "according to...", "described as..." patterns to properly attribute leadership backgrounds and claims.
5. **Properties Table Structure**: Emphasize governance model, founder count, organizational structure. Full leader profiles in Details section. Enables LLM structured data extraction.

**Content Coverage**:
- **Properties table**: 8 structured attributes (governance_model, founder_count, principal, co_founders, founding_year, key_affiliations, public_leadership_pages, leadership_background)
- **Details**: 5 subsections (Joe Liemandt profile, MacKenzie Price profile, Andrew Price profile, Governance Structure, Information Availability note)
- **Examples**: 3 concrete examples (leadership investment, founder journey, multi-org leadership)
- **FAQs**: 5 common questions with authoritative answers
- **Sources**: 5 citations with retrieval dates

**Content Quality Requirements**:
- All facts trace to research/organization.md lines 90-122
- Public information only - no speculation about private structure
- Information gaps explicitly noted (no leadership page on website)
- Attribution for backgrounds and roles
- Three leader profiles: Joe Liemandt (Principal/Founder), MacKenzie Price (Co-Founder), Andrew Price (Co-Founder/CFO)

**Next Action**:
Implement Spec 004 by writing the actual reference document following the checklist. This can be done by:
1. Using the implement_spec skill (if available)
2. Following the manual checklist in `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md`

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Total specs: 32
- Specs with specs written: 10 (31%)
- Specs implemented: 9 (28%)
- In Progress: 1 (Spec 004 - spec created, implementation pending)
- Planned: 22 (69%)
- Phase 1 progress: 7/7 complete (100%) ✅
- Phase 2 progress: 2/22 implemented (9%), 1 spec created

## 2026-01-20 (Later) - Spec 004 Implemented ✅

**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:
- Implemented Spec 004: Leadership Reference Documentation
- Created `reference/organization/leadership.md` (122 lines, structured API-style documentation)
- Synthesized research from `research/organization.md` lines 90-122 into concise, LLM-optimized reference format
- Followed all 9 Functional Requirements (FR1-FR3)
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 004 marked complete, stats updated (10/32 complete, 31.3%)
- Updated tracking checklist for Spec 004
- Logged activity in activity.log

**Key Details**:
- Third Phase 2 (Reference Documentation) spec implemented
- Used single-phase workflow (documentation specs don't require test foundation)
- Followed API-style template from roadmap.md
- Document structure: H1 + blockquote definition, Overview (3 paragraphs), Properties table (8 properties), Details (5 subsections), Examples (3), Related links, FAQs (5), Sources (5), Footer metadata

**Document Sections Created**:
- **Header**: One-sentence definition capturing Alpha School's leadership structure
- **Overview**: 3-paragraph narrative on founder-led governance, three key leaders, and affiliations
- **Properties Table**: 8 structured attributes (governance_model, founder_count, principal, co_founders, founding_year, key_affiliations, public_leadership_pages, leadership_background)
- **Details**: 5 subsections (Joe Liemandt profile, MacKenzie Price profile, Andrew Price profile, Governance Structure, Information Availability note)
- **Examples**: Leadership investment ($1B AI development), founder journey (MacKenzie Price), multi-org leadership (Andrew Price)
- **Related**: Links to 4 related specs (002, 003, 005, 006)
- **FAQs**: 5 Q&A pairs about leadership
- **Sources**: 5 citations with retrieval dates
- **Footer**: Last updated/verified metadata

**Content Quality (FR2)**:
- All facts traced to research/organization.md lines 90-122 with proper source citations
- Public information boundary strictly enforced (no speculation about internal structure)
- Information gaps explicitly noted (no dedicated leadership pages on website, 404 errors)
- Claims properly attributed (used "described as...", "according to Colossus profile...")
- Three leader profiles complete and accurate

**LLM Optimization (FR3)**:
- Hierarchical structure: 16 total headings (H1 → H2 → H3 for LLM parseability)
- Scannable properties table in GitHub Flavored Markdown with 8 key-value pairs
- Examples with clear H3 delimiters
- Relative links to create documentation graph

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Three Leader Focus**: Limited coverage to three confirmed leaders (Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price) as documented in research
2. **Explicit Information Availability Note**: Documented that alpha.school has no /about, /team, or /leadership pages (all return 404)
3. **Public Information Boundary**: Strictly limited content to publicly available information from reputable sources
4. **Attribution Language**: Used proper attribution for claims ("described as...", "according to...")
5. **Governance Structure Transparency**: Acknowledged limits of public information about formal governance

**Next Action**:
Implement Spec 005: History reference documentation

**Blockers**: None
