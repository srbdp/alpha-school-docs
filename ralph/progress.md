### Spec 001 Created ✅

**Status**: Spec created, ready for implementation

**What was done**:
- Created Spec 001 specification document (`ralph/specs/001-research-sources/spec.md`)
- Created Spec 001 implementation checklist (`ralph/specs/001-research-sources/checklist.md`)
- Updated roadmap.md to reflect Spec 001 status as "In Progress"
- Logged activity in activity.log

**Key Details**:

**Status**: Spec created, ready for implementation

**What was done**:
- Created Spec 003 specification document (`ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/spec.md`)
- Created Spec 003 implementation checklist (`ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/checklist.md`)
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 003 status changed from 📋 Planned to 🚧 In Progress
- Updated stats: In Progress: 1 (3.1%), Planned: 23 (71.9%)
- Logged activity in activity.log
- Updated progress.md with this entry

**Key Details**:

- Priority: High
- Effort: Small (~1 hour)

**Specification Structure**:
- 9 Functional Requirements organized in 3 groups (FR1: Structure, FR2: Quality, FR3: LLM Optimization)
- 103 implementation tasks in checklist
- Single-phase documentation workflow (no test foundation phase)
- Complete output template provided
- Success criteria defined (automated + manual verification)

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Explicit Inference Markers**: No formal mission statement or values page exists on alpha.school. Spec requires clear marking: "Alpha School does not publish a formal mission statement. The mission is inferred from..."
2. **Vision as Aspiration**: $1k tablet and "billion kids" goals are future aspirations, not achievements. Must present as stated vision without implying completion.
3. **Three Core Commitments Section**: Love School, Learn 2x in 2hrs, Learn Life Skills are explicit promises to parents and warrant dedicated subsection.
4. **Learning Science Foundation**: "40 years of proven learning science" claim warrants detailed explanation with specific concepts.
5. **Implicit Values**: No explicit values page exists. All 4 values (High Standards/High Support, Mastery Over Time, Holistic Development, Teacher Investment) are inferred from messaging.

**Content Coverage**:
- **Properties table**: 8 structured attributes (foundational_belief, mission_focus, vision_goal, vision_timeline, core_commitments, learning_philosophy, equity_goal, values)
- **Details**: 5 subsections (Mission, Vision, Values, Three Core Commitments, Learning Science Foundation)
- **Examples**: 3 concrete examples (daily schedule, vision milestone progression, values in action)
- **FAQs**: 5 common questions with authoritative answers
- **Sources**: 5 citations with retrieval dates

**Content Quality Requirements**:
- Distinguish explicit statements vs. inferred content (research/organization.md lines 277-279)
- Present vision goals as aspirations: "Alpha School's stated vision..."
- Note information gaps explicitly: "No formal mission statement. The mission is inferred from..."
- Handle democratization claim: note current $10k-$75k tuition vs. future $1k tablet goal

**Next Action**:
Implement Spec 003 by writing the actual reference document following the checklist. This can be done by:
1. Using the implement_spec skill (if available)
2. Following the manual checklist in `ralph/specs/003-organization-mission/checklist.md`

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Total specs: 32
- Specs with specs written: 9 (28%)
- Specs implemented: 8 (25%)
- In Progress: 1 (Spec 003 - spec created, implementation pending)
- Planned: 23 (72%)
- Phase 1 progress: 7/7 complete (100%) ✅
- Phase 2 progress: 1/22 implemented (4.5%), 1 spec created

## 2026-01-20 (Later) - Spec 004 Created ✅

**Status**: Spec created, ready for implementation

**What was done**:
- Created Spec 004 specification document (`ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/spec.md`)
- Created Spec 004 implementation checklist (`ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md`)
- Updated roadmap.md: Spec 004 status changed from 📋 Planned to 🚧 In Progress
- Updated stats: In Progress: 1 (3.1%), Planned: 22 (68.8%)
- Logged activity in activity.log
- Updated progress.md with this entry

**Key Details**:
- Spec 004 focuses on Leadership reference documentation
- Third Phase 2 spec (following Spec 002 and Spec 003)
- Dependencies: Spec 001a (Complete ✅), Spec 002 (Complete ✅)
- Output: `reference/organization/leadership.md`
- Priority: High
- Effort: Small (~1 hour)

**Specification Structure**:
- 9 Functional Requirements organized in 3 groups (FR1: Structure, FR2: Quality, FR3: LLM Optimization)
- 28 implementation tasks in checklist
- Single-phase documentation workflow (no test foundation phase)
- Complete output template provided
- Success criteria defined (automated + manual verification)

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Three Leader Focus**: research/organization.md lines 90-122 provides detailed information on three confirmed leaders (Joe Liemandt, MacKenzie Price, Andrew Price). Spec limits coverage to these three documented leaders.
2. **Explicit Information Availability Note**: research/organization.md line 119 states Alpha School does not have dedicated leadership pages (404 errors). This information gap must be explicitly documented for transparency.
3. **Public Information Boundary (FR2.4)**: Unique requirement for leadership - strictly limit to publicly available information. Include disclosed roles/backgrounds; exclude internal structure and private compensation.
4. **Attribution Language**: Use "according to...", "described as..." patterns to properly attribute leadership backgrounds and claims.
5. **Properties Table Structure**: Emphasize governance model, founder count, organizational structure. Full leader profiles in Details section. Enables LLM structured data extraction.

**Content Coverage**:
- **Properties table**: 8 structured attributes (governance_model, founder_count, principal, co_founders, founding_year, key_affiliations, public_leadership_pages, leadership_background)
- **Details**: 5 subsections (Joe Liemandt profile, MacKenzie Price profile, Andrew Price profile, Governance Structure, Information Availability note)
- **Examples**: 3 concrete examples (leadership investment, founder journey, multi-org leadership)
- **FAQs**: 5 common questions with authoritative answers
- **Sources**: 5 citations with retrieval dates

**Content Quality Requirements**:
- All facts trace to research/organization.md lines 90-122
- Public information only - no speculation about private structure
- Information gaps explicitly noted (no leadership page on website)
- Attribution for backgrounds and roles
- Three leader profiles: Joe Liemandt (Principal/Founder), MacKenzie Price (Co-Founder), Andrew Price (Co-Founder/CFO)

**Next Action**:
Implement Spec 004 by writing the actual reference document following the checklist. This can be done by:
1. Using the implement_spec skill (if available)
2. Following the manual checklist in `ralph/specs/004-organization-leadership/checklist.md`

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Total specs: 32
- Specs with specs written: 10 (31%)
- Specs implemented: 9 (28%)
- In Progress: 1 (Spec 004 - spec created, implementation pending)
- Planned: 22 (69%)
- Phase 1 progress: 7/7 complete (100%) ✅
- Phase 2 progress: 2/22 implemented (9%), 1 spec created

- Specs with specs written: 11 (34%)
- Specs implemented: 10 (31%)
- In Progress: 1 (Spec 005 - spec created, implementation pending)
