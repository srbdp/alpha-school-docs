## Notes

**Execution Pattern**: Each sub-spec is independent. Run them in any order, or in parallel if desired.

**Recommended Order**:
1. 001a Organization (foundational)
2. 001b Model (core differentiator)
3. 001c Curriculum
4. 001e Enrollment
5. 001f Locations
6. 001d Outcomes
7. 001g Contact

**Agent**: Use `web-research-doc-creator` agent for each sub-spec.
