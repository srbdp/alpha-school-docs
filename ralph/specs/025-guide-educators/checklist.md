## Notes and Decisions

### Content Strategy Decisions

**To be determined during Phase 3.0**:
- Specific pedagogical theories to reference
- Specific professional FAQ questions (after source review)
- Educator testimonial selection (after outcomes review)
- Example selection for model and curriculum sections
- Appropriate research detail level for each topic
- Evidence presentation format (tables vs. narrative)

### Tone Guidelines

**Established**:
- Professional and collegial (educator-to-educator)
- Research-informed (reference learning science, educational theory)
- Methodologically honest (transparent about evidence gaps)
- Academic/professional framing (not marketing)
- Appropriate educational terminology
- Rigorous yet accessible

### Professional Framing Approach

**Key Differences from Parent Guide**:
- More pedagogical depth and theory
- Explicit research context and methodology
- Educational terminology and concepts
- Focus on instructional design, not just outcomes
- Professional engagement, not enrollment
- Evidence quality and methodology transparency

### Section Length Targets

**Planned distribution (2,500-3,500 words total)**:
- Introduction: 300-400 words
- Educational Model & Philosophy: 1,800-2,300 words (largest section, most pedagogical depth)
- Curriculum Design: 600-700 words
- Outcomes & Research: 1,200-1,600 words (more methodological detail than parent guide)
- Organizational Structure: 500-600 words
- Professional Questions: 500-600 words
- Professional Engagement: 400-500 words

### Pedagogical Context Framework

**Theories/Research to Reference** (to be refined in Phase 3.0):
- Constructivism and student-centered learning
- Personalized/adaptive learning research
- Mastery-based learning and competency models
- Time-on-task and learning efficiency research
- AI in education research (current state)
- Formative assessment and feedback
- Bloom's taxonomy and learning objectives
- Differentiation and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
