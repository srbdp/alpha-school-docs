# Daily Schedule

> Alpha School's daily schedule divides into a focused 2-hour morning block for mastering core academics through AI-powered personalized instruction, followed by 2.5-4 hours of afternoon life skills workshops and real-world project-based learning.

## Overview

Alpha School's daily structure balances academic mastery with holistic development through a two-part schedule: a focused 2-hour morning academic block followed by 2.5-4 hours of afternoon life skills workshops and project-based activities, with a lunch break between sessions. This structure reflects Alpha's philosophy that efficient academic instruction creates time for comprehensive personal development beyond traditional subjects.

The morning block begins with "Limitless Launch" goal-setting, then transitions to AI-powered personalized academics across core subjects (math, English, science, social studies) using the Pomodoro technique—25-minute focused blocks with breaks between subjects. Guides monitor student progress without providing academic instruction, and students complete core academics by lunchtime, achieving mastery standards (90%+ accuracy) through one-on-one AI tutoring.

Afternoons focus on developing 24 life skills through hands-on collaborative workshops, project-based learning, and real-world business operations. Students engage in entrepreneurship (running profitable Airbnb operations and food trucks), athletic training (5K races, sports academy programs), public speaking progression (from speaking to cats to open mic nights in New York), and outdoor education (rock climbing, sailing expeditions, wilderness skills). The afternoon program emphasizes interactive, collaborative learning that contrasts with the morning's solo AI-based academics.

## Details

### Morning Academic Block (8:00-10:00)

The morning academic block begins with "Limitless Launch," a goal-setting session where students establish daily objectives. Students then work one-on-one with AI tutors across four core subjects—math, English, science, and social studies—using the Pomodoro technique: 25-minute focused sessions alternating between subjects with short breaks between blocks.

During the academic block, students complete personalized assignments to mastery standards (90%+ accuracy requirement) with AI platforms (Timeback and Dash) providing immediate feedback, targeted practice, and adaptive difficulty. Guides monitor student progress throughout the morning but provide zero academic instruction—their role focuses on motivation, mentorship, and ensuring students stay engaged through AI dashboard monitoring.

The academic block typically completes by lunchtime (around 10:00 AM for schools starting at 8:00 AM), with core academics finished for the day. This structure enables students to complete what Alpha School claims is a full grade level of material in 20-30 hours per subject (compared to approximately 200 hours in traditional schooling), though these efficiency claims are self-reported without independent verification. For detailed morning academic structure, see the Two-Hour Learning Model documentation.

### Lunch Transition

Following the completion of morning academics (typically around 10:00 AM), students have a lunch break that serves as the transition between solo AI-based academics and collaborative afternoon activities. The specific duration of the lunch break is not disclosed in publicly available materials and may vary by campus. This break separates the focused, screen-based morning learning from the interactive, hands-on afternoon program.

### Afternoon Life Skills Program (Post-Lunch, 2.5-4 hours)

The afternoon program focuses on developing 24 life skills through hands-on collaborative workshops and project-based learning. This component lasts 2.5-4 hours (varying by campus and grade level) and emphasizes interactive, collaborative formats that contrast with the morning's solo AI work.

The 24 life skills taught include:
- **Leadership** - Guiding teams, making decisions, taking responsibility
- **Teamwork** - Collaborating effectively, supporting peers, group problem-solving
- **Entrepreneurship** - Business planning, profit calculations, customer service
- **Financial Literacy** - Budgeting, pricing strategy, financial record-keeping
- **Public Speaking** - Presentation skills, confidence-building, performance progression
- **Relationship-Building** - Communication, empathy, connection skills
- **Coding** - Programming fundamentals, computational thinking
- **Outdoor Education** - Rock climbing, sailing, wilderness skills
- **Grit and Resilience** - Perseverance, overcoming challenges, mental toughness
- **Athletic Training** - Physical fitness, sports skills, competition preparation
- **NIL Negotiations and Press Conferences** (sports academy) - Media training, contract understanding
- Additional skills across personal development, creative arts, and practical life competencies

Guides facilitate these workshops, maintaining their mentorship role beyond academics. The afternoon structure emphasizes hands-on experience, collaborative problem-solving, and real-world application—students learn through doing rather than traditional instruction.

### Real-World Project Integration

According to Alpha School materials, students engage in actual business operations and real-world projects that generate tangible outcomes. These project-based activities integrate multiple life skills into authentic experiences:

**Student-Run Businesses:**
- Fifth graders reportedly operate profitable Airbnb properties, managing pricing strategy, guest communication, property maintenance scheduling, and financial record-keeping
- Students run food truck operations, handling menu planning, ingredient sourcing, pricing, customer service, and profit calculation
- Business ventures generate actual profit, providing authentic entrepreneurship experience

**Athletic Programs:**
- Younger students train for and complete 5K races
- Sports academy participants engage in NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) negotiations and press conferences, learning media relations and contract concepts
- Athletic training programs develop physical fitness alongside life skills

**Public Speaking Progression:**
- Students progress from speaking to cats (comfort-building) to classroom presentations to open mic nights in New York City
- Structured progression builds confidence through escalating real-world performance experiences

**Outdoor Education:**
- Rock climbing expeditions teaching risk assessment and physical courage
- Sailing programs developing navigation, teamwork, and responsibility
- Wilderness skills instruction covering outdoor survival and environmental awareness

These real-world projects are reported in Alpha School materials as examples of their afternoon program. The outcomes (profitable businesses, student achievements) represent Alpha's descriptions of the program and are not independently verified.

### Daily Flow and Student Experience

The daily structure creates distinct learning modes throughout the day. Mornings emphasize individual focus—students work solo with AI platforms, maintaining concentration through Pomodoro technique rotations, achieving mastery in core academic content. The atmosphere is quiet, screen-based, and self-paced.

After lunch, the learning mode shifts dramatically. Afternoons emphasize collaboration—students work in teams, engage in hands-on activities, participate in outdoor experiences, and run actual businesses. The atmosphere becomes interactive, physical, and socially engaged.

This variety throughout the day provides alternating experiences: screen time transitions to hands-on activities, solo work shifts to collaborative projects, indoor academics give way to outdoor education. Students experience different learning formats—AI-powered personalization in the morning, guide-facilitated workshops in the afternoon, self-directed project work, team-based problem-solving.

Exact timing, campus-specific schedule variations, and grade-level differences in daily structure are not disclosed in publicly available materials. The general pattern (morning academics → lunch → afternoon life skills) appears consistent across Alpha School campuses, but specific start times, dismissal times, and detailed daily schedules may vary by location.
