## Information Gaps

The following contact information was **NOT found** during research:

1. **General Inquiry Phone Number** - No phone number is published on the official alpha.school website. The phone number (512) 358-1672 was found only via third-party directories and may not be actively monitored.

2. **Campus-Specific Phone Numbers** - No direct phone lines for individual campus locations are published.

3. **Dedicated Contact Page** - alpha.school/contact returns a 404 error; the site routes all inquiries through the "Learn More" web form instead.

4. **Dedicated Press/Media Page** - alpha.school/press returns a 404 error; only a press email (press@2hourlearning.com) is available.

5. **Corporate Mailing Address** - No separate corporate/headquarters mailing address is identified beyond the Austin PK-8 campus address (1201 Spyglass Dr, Austin, TX 78746).

6. **Press Kit or Media Assets** - No downloadable press kit, logo pack, or media assets page was found.

7. **Investor/Partnership Contact** - No specific contact for investor relations or partnership inquiries was found.

8. **Dorado and The Woodlands Addresses** - These two campuses have "Address TBA" listed on the locations page.

## Notes

### Contact Strategy
Alpha School appears to intentionally route all inquiries through web forms (HubSpot-powered) rather than publishing direct phone numbers or email addresses. This is a common approach for managing high volumes of inquiries and ensuring proper routing.

### Email Domains
- **alpha.school** domain: Used for registrar@alpha.school and admissions@alpha.school
- **2hourlearning.com** domain: Used for press@2hourlearning.com (press inquiries)
- The use of the 2hourlearning.com domain for press contact suggests this may be a parent organization or related brand

### Third-Party Data Reliability
- The phone number (512) 358-1672 found via Buzzfile should be verified before publication, as it is not listed on the official website
- The admissions@alpha.school email was found via third-party sources; prefer using the official "Learn More" form for admissions inquiries

### Crunchbase Access
- Crunchbase profile returned 403 (access blocked), so data from this source could not be verified

### Headquarters Confirmation
- LinkedIn confirms 1201 Spyglass Dr, Austin, TX 78746 as the headquarters address
- This is the same address as the Austin PK-8 campus
