## Key Facts

### From alpha.school

#### Curriculum Overview

**Philosophy: Mastery-Based Learning**
- Students must demonstrate "over 90% accuracy before the system allows them to move on"
- Contrasts with traditional schools where "a student can pass with 70%"
- Based on four decades of learning science principles:
  - Bloom's 2 Sigma (tutoring effectiveness research)
  - Zone of proximal development
  - Cognitive load theory
  - Active learning principles
- Eliminates cumulative knowledge gaps through mastery requirements
- Personalized instruction delivered at each student's pace and level

**Key Claim:** An entire grade level of material in one subject requires only 20-30 hours of focused study through AI tutoring (compared to ~200 hours in traditional schooling)

**AI-Powered Platform:**
- Platform called "Time Back" (also referred to as "Dash" for curriculum system)
- Provides "personalized 1:1 learning" with adaptive instruction
- NOT a chatbot - functions as a tutor and coach
- Generates personalized lessons and targeted feedback
- Creates "knowledge graph" of what each student knows

#### Subjects Taught

**Core Academics (2-Hour Morning Block):**
- Mathematics
- English/Language Arts (reading, language arts)
- Science
- History/Social Studies

**Delivery Method:**
- AI-powered platform provides personalized instruction
- 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with breaks between subjects

#### Grade Levels

**K-12 Programs:**

**Note from FAQ:** "It depends on the location. For example, Alpha Austin is a preK-12 school. Alpha works in levels that are based on specific capabilities as opposed to traditional grade models."

**PreK-8 Students:**
- Structured curriculum with systematic skill-building
- Follow prescribed workshop curricula
- Guided progression through core academics

**High School Students:**

**From Parent Testimonials (Web Search Results):**

**Parent Quote 1:**
"My kids have been at Alpha's Austin campus for 5 years. I have witnessed a tremendous amount of growth in them academically and have been impressed with the life skills they have mastered."

**Parent Quote 2:**
"This is our 8th year at Alpha and we could not be happier. Academically, my kids are excelling at Alpha; personally they are thriving. Goal-setting, project-management, financial literacy, teamwork, giving and receiving feedback, public speaking... these are some of the life skills they work on daily through academic work and afternoon workshops."

**Parent Quote 3:**
"What I love most about Alpha is the guides. The teacher to student ratio is pretty low. The guides are not there to teach subjects, but to connect, guide, and encourage kids to use available tools or even create their own to help themselves through challenges."

**Parent Quote 4:**
"Parent involvement is welcomed and communication is consistent and thoughtful. Most importantly, our son is thriving - happy, motivated, and excited for what's ahead."

**Tuition Comparison:**
- Austin campus: $40,000/year
- Brownsville campus: $10,000/year (demonstrating model accessibility)

**Brownsville Results:**
- After nine months on Alpha program, first cohort caught up and surpassed national average
- Achieved ~2x national average learning velocity
- Intended to show model effectiveness beyond "rich-kid selection effects"

## Information Gaps

The following curriculum-related information was not found or remains unclear:

### Not Found

1. **Detailed Curriculum Scope and Sequence**: No publicly available document showing specific learning objectives by grade level or subject progression.

2. **Foreign Language Specifics**: While foreign language is mentioned as a subject, specific languages offered are not documented.

3. **Science Curriculum Details**: Beyond mentioning "science" as a subject, no specific topics, experiments, or lab components are described.

4. **Social Studies Content**: Beyond noting history and geography are "integrated into reading passages," no curriculum specifics provided.

5. **High School Course Catalog**: No detailed listing of AP courses offered or graduation requirements.

6. **Accommodations for Special Needs**: No information found about curriculum modifications for students with learning differences.

7. **Curriculum Alignment Documentation**: While Common Core and AP are mentioned, no detailed alignment documents are publicly available.

8. **Independent Curriculum Audit**: No third-party academic review of curriculum quality or standards alignment.

### Partially Documented

1. **Mastery Thresholds**: Some sources cite 80% accuracy required, others cite 90%+ - inconsistency in documentation.

2. **Writing Instruction**: AlphaWrite is described but acknowledged as needing improvement; unclear what supplementary writing instruction exists.

3. **Assessment Beyond MAP**: While MAP testing is well-documented, other assessment methods (portfolios, projects, presentations) are mentioned but not detailed.

4. **College Preparation**: SAT scores are mentioned, but specific college prep curriculum (test prep, college counseling) is not detailed.

## Notes

### Source Conflicts and Inconsistencies

1. **Mastery Threshold Discrepancy**:
   - Alpha School website states: "over 90% accuracy"
   - GenWise Substack and Astral Codex Ten report: "80% accuracy"
   - **Resolution**: May reflect different thresholds for different assessment types (daily lessons vs. mastery tests)

2. **Platform Naming**:
   - Main platform variously called "Time Back" and "Dash"
   - "Dash" may be the curriculum management/recommendation layer
   - "Time Back" may be the student-facing learning platform

3. **Subject Integration**:
   - Some sources list history and social studies separately
   - Other sources indicate "history and geography content is integrated into reading passages"
   - **Resolution**: May vary by grade level or campus

### Caveats on Claims

1. **Academic Outcome Claims**: All performance claims (2.6x growth, 99th percentile, etc.) come from Alpha School's own data or reporting. No independent third-party verification has been published.

2. **MAP Test Limitations**: Critics note that MAP tests measure certain skills but may not capture all aspects of learning (creativity, critical thinking, writing ability, etc.).

3. **Selection Effects**: Despite Brownsville campus results, some educators question whether observed outcomes reflect curriculum effectiveness or student/family self-selection.

4. **Writing Instruction Quality**: The Astral Codex Ten review explicitly noted AlphaWrite is "not good enough" and the school acknowledged it needs redesign.

5. **New and Evolving Model**: Alpha School's curriculum and technology are actively evolving; documentation may not reflect current practices.

### Verified Facts

The following are consistently reported across multiple independent sources:

- K-12 grade levels served
- 2-hour morning academic block structure
- Use of MAP (NWEA) standardized assessments three times yearly
- Core subjects: math, English/language arts, science, social studies
- Afternoon life skills workshops (~4 hours)
- "Guides" instead of teachers for academic block
- Use of IXL as primary third-party platform
- 24 life skills framework
- Mastery-based progression (not time-based)
