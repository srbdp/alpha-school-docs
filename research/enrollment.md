## Notes

**Key Observations:**

1. **Tuition Variance**: Significant price range ($10,000 - $75,000) across locations. Brownsville appears subsidized/intentionally affordable while San Francisco is positioned as premium.

2. **Rolling Admissions**: No fixed enrollment windows or deadlines - families can apply throughout the year. This is notable compared to traditional private schools with set application periods.

3. **Level-Based vs. Grade-Based**: Alpha uses capability-based levels rather than traditional grades, which affects how "eligibility" and placement work.

4. **All-Inclusive Model**: Tuition includes all activities, trips, and supplies - no additional fundraising or fees. This is explicitly marketed as a differentiator.

5. **Voucher Strategy**: Micro-school model ($15k) combined with school vouchers (~$12k) is designed to make Alpha accessible at ~$300-400/month in voucher-eligible states.

6. **Mixed Reviews**: AIFunLab article suggests mixed parent experiences ("Failed Some Parents—and Kept Others"), worth noting for balanced perspective.

7. **High School Separate**: Alpha High School (alphahigh.school) appears to be a separate entity/brand from the main K-8 Alpha schools.

8. **Contact Variations**: Different contact methods found:
   - General: registrar@alpha.school
   - Austin Admissions: admissions@alpha.school, 512-358-1672
   - Parents should contact specific campus for location-specific pricing

**States with Locations:**
Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Virginia (based on immunization requirements list)
