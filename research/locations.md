- Website mentions "Bring Alpha To Your City" suggesting community-driven expansion interest
- Some campuses (Chantilly) operate within existing Guidepost Montessori facilities
- Texas ESA (Education Savings Account) program may provide ~$10,300 toward Texas Sports Academy tuition
- Campus count varies in sources (some say 13, some 14, some 16-17) - likely depends on counting method and date of source
- Multiple expansion waves through partnerships (Guidepost Montessori) and acquisitions (Higher Ground Education)
- All campuses follow standardized schedule (8:15 AM - 4:00 PM) and educational model
