## Key Facts

### From alpha.school

#### Educational Philosophy

**Three Core Commitments to Parents:**
1. Students will love school more than vacation
2. Students will master academics and score in the top 1% nationally in only two hours per day
3. Success requires "high standards, high support"

**Learning Science Foundation:**
The model is described as built on 40 years of established learning science, specifically citing:
- Bloom's 2 Sigma (tutoring effectiveness research)
- Zone of proximal development
- Cognitive load theory
- Active learning principles

**Mastery-Based Approach:**
- Students advance only after demonstrating proficiency (over 90% accuracy)
- Contrasts with traditional models where "a student can pass with 70%"
- Designed to prevent cumulative knowledge gaps by ensuring solid foundational understanding

**Core Belief (Claim):** Traditional six-hour classroom days are inefficient, with lecture retention reportedly as low as 5%

**Founder's Core Belief:**
- "Kids should love school"
- Traditional one-teacher-to-many-students classroom model is "fundamentally broken"
- Education system based on "hundred-year-old model from the Industrial Revolution"

#### 2-Hour Learning Model

**Structure:**
- Students complete core academics in a focused two-hour morning block
- Uses AI-powered adaptive platform for personalized, one-on-one instruction
- Covers math, English, science, and social studies
- Uses Pomodoro technique: alternating 25-minute blocks across subjects with breaks

**Key Claims (from Alpha School materials):**
- "Alpha classes learn twice as fast as their peers and rank in the top 1% nationwide"
- An entire grade level of material in one subject requires only 20-30 hours to master on the platform
- Students spend 10-15% of the time (20-30 hours per subject per year) compared to traditional schooling (200 hours per subject per year)
- "In two hours a day, students learn twice as much as their peers who spend six hours a day in a traditional classroom"

**Reported Outcomes (from Alpha School data):**
- Students experience "2.6x growth" on standardized assessments (MAP tests) compared to traditional peers
- Top two-thirds of students learning 3.6x faster
- Top 20% (top performers) achieve up to 6.5x growth rates
- Students "learn 2.3 times more per school year than statistical models predict"
- Median SAT scores of 1530/1600 for seniors (from Modern Wisdom podcast)
- College graduates maintaining 4.0 GPAs (claimed, with rare exceptions)

**Student Satisfaction Claims:**
- 95% of students report loving school
- 60% would choose school over vacation
- Over 90% said they love going to school

#### AI Integration

**Platform Names:** "Time Back" (learning platform), "Dash" (curriculum system)

**How It Works:**
- Provides personalized, one-on-one instruction through adaptive AI
- NOT a chatbot like ChatGPT (Alpha explicitly states those "enable cheating")
- Functions as a tutor and coach
- Generates personalized lessons and targeted feedback
- Keeps constant monitoring of student performance, adjusting lessons in real-time
- Creates "knowledge graph" of what each student knows

### Potential Biases and Caveats

1. **Selection Bias:** High tuition ($40,000-$75,000) means student population is not representative of general population. Results may not generalize to broader populations. AEI notes "most students come from wealthier families."

2. **Brownsville Exception:** The Brownsville campus ($10,000 tuition) serving low-income families provides some counter-evidence, but sample sizes and detailed methodology unknown.

3. **Self-Reported Data:** All academic outcome claims come from Alpha School itself. No independent audit or peer review has verified results.

4. **Comparison Groups:** When claiming "2.6x faster than peers," the comparison methodology is not clearly documented. What constitutes the comparison group is unclear.

5. **Limited Track Record:** Only one graduating class (12 students) to date. AEI expert Nat Malkus notes "how well the Alpha model works is an open question."

6. **Founder Background:** MacKenzie Price is not a trained educator; she has a psychology degree and previously worked in mortgage lending. This is relevant context.

7. **Parent Self-Selection:** Price acknowledges that "willing-to-innovate parents may inherently support children's success beyond socioeconomic factors alone."

### Conflicts Between Sources

- **Platform Name:** Some sources refer to "Time Back" while others reference "Dash" - may be different components or name evolution
- **Tuition Range:** Varies significantly by source ($10,000 to $75,000 reported) - reflects actual variation by location
- **Number of Campuses:** "8 schools" vs "16 campuses" - may reflect growth between reporting dates or difference in counting methodology
- **Student Count:** One source mentions "152 students" enrolled; scale at other campuses unknown

### Expert Skepticism (Documented)

- **Kate Johanns (Association of Texas Professional Educators):** Questions AI's ability to differentiate instruction and form parent relationships: "I think the benefit of a good teacher is the ability to differentiate instruction. The other thing that I think AI might miss is the ability to form relationships with parents."

- **Nat Malkus (AEI Senior Fellow):** "How well the Alpha model works is an open question" given limited track record

- **General Educator Skepticism:** Multiple sources note the model remains "unproven" in traditional educational research terms

- **No Independent Validation:** Wikipedia article (not directly accessed) reportedly notes lack of peer-reviewed studies

### Expert Support (Documented)

- **Colleen Hroncich (Cato Institute):** Praised individualized approach; supports school choice and innovation

- **Nat Malkus (AEI):** While noting limitations, frames Alpha as demonstrating "what it might look like if schools took some of the boldest ideas in education more seriously"
