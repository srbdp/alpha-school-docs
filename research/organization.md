## Key Facts

### From alpha.school

#### Overview

Alpha School is a private K-12 institution featuring an AI-powered educational model. The organization describes itself as an "AI Powered Private School" that operates through what they call the "2 Hour Learning" model.

**Core Educational Model:**
- Mastery-based learning compressed into a two-hour academic block
- Students work one-on-one with AI tutors on personalized, adaptive curricula
- Once academics are completed, students spend the remaining school day on life skills workshops and passion projects
- Mastery requirement: students must demonstrate 90%+ accuracy before advancing (vs. traditional 70% passing)
- Teachers ("Guides") earn minimum $100,000 salaries, focusing on mentorship rather than instruction

**Key Claims:**
- Students "learn twice as fast as their peers" and "rank in the top 1% nationwide"
- On average, Alpha students grow 2.6 times faster than peers on nationally normed MAP tests
- Top performers achieve up to 6.5x growth
- The system eliminates traditional homework through efficiency
- 96% of kids say they love school; 40-60% say they'd rather attend school than go on vacation

**Primary Tagline:** "Learn 2x in 2hrs"

**Secondary Tagline:** "Children can be limitless. Let us show you how."

**Three Core Commitments/Promises to Parents:**
1. **Love School** - "Your child will love school more than vacation" - Students develop genuine enthusiasm for learning
2. **Learn 2x in 2hrs** - Academic mastery with top 1% performance in only two hours daily
3. **Learn Life Skills** - Students develop critical life skills through high standards and high support; afternoon workshops (4 hours) emphasize entrepreneurship, leadership, financial literacy, public speaking, and teamwork

#### Mission

**Foundational Philosophy:** Alpha School's core belief is that traditional schooling constrains students unnecessarily. The mission centers on "unlocking children's potential through a revolutionary educational model."

**Core Belief:** Children are "limitless" and can achieve far more than traditional education allows when given personalized, mastery-based instruction.

**Learning Science Foundation:** The model is built on "40 years of proven learning science" including concepts like the "zone of proximal development" and cognitive load theory. The approach prioritizes "switching education from a time-based system to a mastery-based system where students must demonstrate proficiency before moving on."

**Joe Liemandt's Framing:** Education is "a trillion-dollar market with no good products." The goal is to give children "their childhoods back" by compressing academic instruction into two hours daily while maintaining mastery-level performance.

#### Vision

**Long-Term Vision:** Making AI-powered personalized education accessible globally. The stated goal is:
- "A sub-$1,000 tablet that teaches everything in two hours"
- Reaching "a billion kids" within 20 years
- Democratizing education that currently costs $40-75k annually at Alpha campuses

Joe Liemandt frames AI as "the light microscope for education" - finally enabling individualized instruction at scale that pedagogical research has long advocated.

- **High Standards, High Support** - Young people thrive when held to elevated expectations within highly supportive environments
- **Mastery Over Time** - Focus on 90%+ proficiency vs. traditional time-based progression
- **Holistic Development** - Academics + life skills + passion projects
- **Teacher/Guide Investment** - Paying guides $100,000+ (roughly double average teacher pay)

*Note: No explicit "Our Values" page found on alpha.school. Values inferred from organizational messaging.*

#### History

**Founding Date:** 2014 (founded); First campus opened 2016

**Key Milestones:**
- **2014:** MacKenzie Price founded the school (initially called "Emergent Academy") for her daughters (then in 3rd and 1st grade); partnered with Brian Holtz, a parent at Acton Academy
- **2014:** Started in Brian Holtz's house with 16 kids, including the Price daughters
- **2016:** Original campus formally established
- **2022:** Following generative AI emergence, Joe Liemandt invested approximately $1 billion to develop Timeback platform
- **2025:** First class of seniors graduated (11 of 12 graduates went to four-year universities)
- **2025:** Alpha High opened year-round at students' request
- **2025:** New campus launches: Alpha Raleigh (Fall 2025, K-3), Alpha Anywhere Center NYC (Fall 2025, K-8), Santa Barbara, Chantilly VA, Charlotte NC
- **2025:** San Francisco campus opened as city's most expensive private school ($75,000/year)

**Origin Story:**
Alpha School originally branched off Acton Academy, a franchise of microschools. MacKenzie Price was frustrated when told that changing the existing education system was "like trying to steer the Titanic." The school started in a house with 16 kids using adaptive apps (Khan Academy, ALEKS, Math Academy, Newsela, DreamBox, etc.) for personalized, self-paced education, with afternoons dedicated to activities like "neighborhood lemonade stand wars" and "Hero's Journey performances."

**Platform Development:**
- **Timeback:** AI-powered personalized learning platform developed ~2022 with $1B investment
- **Incept:** Custom LLM for curriculum generation
- **Vision monitoring:** Tracks student engagement and "anti-patterns"
- Uses applications from IXL, Khan Academy, Trilogy Software, and school's own engineers

## Notes

### Source Conflicts and Clarifications

1. **Employee Count:** LinkedIn shows conflicting numbers (462 employees vs. 51-200 company size range). The larger number may include all affiliated schools/organizations.

2. **Founder Attribution:** Different sources attribute founding differently:
   - Some credit MacKenzie Price and Andrew Price as founders
   - Some include Joe Liemandt as founder/principal
   - Joe Liemandt joined later (daughters attended after founding) but has invested $1B and is heavily involved

3. **"2 Hour Learning" Claims:** Critics note that actual school day is longer than 2 hours:
   - Students start school at 8:30am
   - Platform work runs from 9:00-9:30am until noon-12:30pm
   - Total academic time is closer to 3-3.5 hours

4. **AI Definition:** Critics argue the system uses "adaptive learning software" and "spaced-repetition algorithms" rather than generative AI in the modern sense (pre-dates ChatGPT)

### Potential Conflicts of Interest (Noted in Media)

News sources have reported governance concerns:
- At related schools (e.g., Unbound Academy), board members are affiliated with 2 Hour Learning, Trilogy Enterprises, and Crossover Markets, which serve as vendors
- Andrew Price appears on governing boards while serving as CFO of Trilogy, the schools' main vendor

### Sensitive Topics

- Charter school applications have been rejected in multiple states
- High tuition costs ($40K-$75K) vs. stated goal of democratizing education
- Claims of academic results have not been independently verified according to some reports
- Monitoring technology (vision tracking of student engagement) raises privacy considerations
